Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, all applications for study leave shall be submitted with the Audit Officer‟s or Pay and Accounts Officer‟s certificate, as the case may be, to Government through the prescribed channel and the course or courses of study contemplated and any examination which the member of the service proposes to undergo shall be clearly specified therein. If the course of study is out of India, Government will forward to the Head of Mission, if there is an Indian Mission in that country, a copy of the approved programme of study. In case where it is not possible for the member of the Service to give full details in his original application, or if, after leaving India, he is to make any change in the programme which has been approved in India, he shall submit the particulars as soon as possible to the Head of Mission or the Government, as the case may be. In such case he shall not, unless prepared to do so at his own risk, commence the course of study or incur any expenses in connection therewith until he receives approval of the Government to the course.\\n\\n2 (1) On an application for the study leave out of India being sanctioned by the Government, it shall inform the Head of Mission, if there is an Indian Mission in that country, of the particulars of the case.\\n\\n(2) The member of the Service shall also place himself in communication with the Head of Mission, if there is an Indian Mission in that country, and he will arrange any details and issue any letter of introduction that may be required.\\n\\n3. On completion of a course of study a certificate in form prescribed by Government together with certificates of examinations passed or special courses of study undertaken, indicating the dates of commencement and termination of the course with remarks, if any, of the authority in charge of the course of study, shall be forwarded to the Head of Mission concerned.

Executive Instruction ‘B’-Prior approval of the Central Government is necessary for ex-India deputation/leave :- All cases, in which the State Government propose to send a member of an All India Service abroad on deputation or on leave due and admissible to him (including study leave) should be referred to the Department of Personnel in the case of members of the Indian Administrative Service, the Ministry of Home Affairs in the case of members of the Indian Police Service and the Ministry of Environment and Forests in the case of the members of the Indian Forest Service.\\n\\n(Department of Personnel and A.R. letter No. 9/26/71—AIS(III), dated 23-9-1972).\\n\\n2. General procedure to be followed by the applicant for facilitating proper examination of applications for ex-India deputation/leave: - Applications referred to above are required to be examined in consultation with the Ministries of Finance (Department of Economic Affairs and Expenditure), External Affairs and often the Ministry of Education and S.W. Clearance from the view point of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act is also required in most cases. Accordingly, late submission of applications for placement in Foreign Universities or grant of study leave not only causes avoidable inconvenience to the concerned Departments but causes unnecessary anxiety to the applicants themselves.\\n\\n2. The following procedure is therefore laid down with a view to facilitating proper\\n\\nexamination of such applications:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nApplications seeking admission to or grant of study leave for pursuing higher studies abroad should be forwarded to this Department at least two months before the last date prescribed for the purpose, unless there are convincing reasons for not doing so.\\n\\nBefore forwarding applications for grant of study leave to this Department the State Government should satisfy themselves that the applicants fulfill the conditions of eligibility laid down in the AIS (Study Leave) Regulations, 1960. It is imperative that the State Government / Administrative Ministries furnish the certificate prescribed under regulation 3 of the AIS (Study Leave) Regulation 1960.\\n\\n(iii) While forwarding applications for placement in foreign Universities / grant of study leave State Governments etc. should furnish full particulars of the course of study, viz. the subjects in which admission is sought, the duration of the course, whether it leads to the award of a degree, diploma etc. The duration and nature of the leave required should also be specified.\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\nThe manner in which the officer proposes to finance his stay abroad and in particular, to meet the foreign exchange requirements while on study abroad should be clearly spelt out. In case the officer proposes to seek or avail himself of any financial assistance by way of a scholarship or fellowship or take up part-time employment, the quantum, break up and source of the assistance/ remuneration, should also be mentioned.\\n\\n48\\n\\n(v)\\n\\n(vi)\\n\\nMembers of the Service concerned and the sponsoring Governments/ Administrative Ministries should not presume the sanction of study leave.\\n\\nApplicants should not make any preparations for journey etc. in anticipation of sanction of study leave to avoid frustration. They will do so only at their risk.\\n\\n(D.P& A.R.‟s letter No. 11020/20/77—AIS(III), dated 26th October, 1977).\\n\\n3. Power of the Central Government to grant study leave in India has been delegated to the Ministries/Departments of the Government of India: - The powers of the Central Government to grant study leave in India under the All India Service (Study Leave) Regulations, 1960 to members of the All India Service working in or under them and those who are serving under a foreign Government are delegated to the Ministries / Departments of the Government of India.\\n\\n2. It may, however, be ensured that the concurrence of the State Government on whose cadre the officer concerned is permanently borne is invariably obtained as required under sub-regulation (6) of regulation 3 of the All India Services (Study Leave) Regulations, 1960. Prior concurrence of the Department of Agriculture28 in respect of members of the Indian Forest Service and the Ministry of Home Affairs in respect of the Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service borne on the U.T. Cadre, should also be obtained.\\n\\n[G.O.I. Deptt. of Personnel O.M. No. 11020/20/77—AIS(III), dt. 20-11-78.]\\n\\n4. The moS should serve the government for 2 to 3 years after returning from long-term training abroad before being recommended for study leave: - I am directed to refer to executive instructions issued under AIS(Study Leave) Regulations, which provides that before forwarding applications for grant of Study leave to this Department, the State Government should satisfy themselves that the applicants fulfill the condition of eligibility laid down in the AIS(Study Leave) Regulations.\\n\\n2. In this regard, several cases have come to the notice of the Government where it has been seen that officers are being recommended for grant of study leave despite the fact that they have not served the Government for 2 or 3 years after returning from a long- term Government sponsored training programme abroad as they are bound to, in terms of the bond all such officers are required to sign before proceeding on training.\\n\\n3. It is requested that henceforth in such cases, State Governments should give due consideration to this aspect and refrain from sending their recommendations to the Department of Personnel & Training.\\n\\n(DOPT Letter No.11020/6/94—AIS(III) Dated 20.7.94 to the Chief Secretaries of all State Govts.)\\n\\nGOVERNMENT OF INDIA’S ORDERS UNDER REGULATION 3\\n\\n1. Study leave shall not be granted before completion of seven years of Service: - Study leave shall not ordinarily be granted to a member of the Service who has rendered less than seven years of service under the Government.\\n\\n2. This Department has been receiving proposals wherein the State Governments have recommended grant of extra ordinary leave, earned leave or other kinds of leave for the purpose of study even much before completion of seven years of service. This is in\\n\\n28 To be read as Ministry of Environment & Forests in the present context.\\n\\n49\\n\\neffect circumvention of the provision of the regulation 3(4)(i) of the AIS (Study Leave) Regulations, 1960.\\n\\n3. The All India Services provide sufficient opportunities to their members to develop their personality by working in various responsible posts. The first seven years in service are the formative years and the members of the services should devote their time and energy to acquiring experience in their area of work in order to develop themselves for future higher responsibilities. No academic qualification can be a substitute for the experience acquired through handling various responsibilities in the Governments\\n\\n4. It would be in the public interest and also in the interest of the members of Services that first few years are devoted to enrichment through work experience instead of acquiring academic qualifications.\\n\\n5. It, therefore, has been decided that neither study leave should be granted nor any other leave like earned leave or extra ordinary leave should be granted to a member of the Service for the purpose of study before completion of seven years of service under the Government.\\n\\n6. It is requested that these instructions may be brought to the notice of the members working in the respective State cadre.\\n\\n(Letter No. 11020/10/97—AIS—III dated 22.12.1997 to the Chief Secretaries of All States/UTs.)\\n\\n2. The moS should submit a full report on the work done on study leave after completion of leave: - As per Regulation 3(1)(iv), there is no requirement of submitting the study report at the end of study leave by a member of the Service.\\n\\n2. Now it has been decided that in cases where study leave is granted under this Regulation, a member of the Service should be required to submit, on his/her return a full report on the work done by him/her on study leave.\\n\\n(GOI, DOPT Letter No. 11020/18/94—AIS(III) dated 9.8.1994.)\\n\\nGOVERNMENT OF INDIA’S ORDERS UNDER REGULATION 10\\n\\n1.

It has been decided now to approve these fellowships as approved courses of studies for the purpose of grant of study leave under the AIS (Study Leave) Regulation, 1960, in view of these fellowships being of national level standards and involving substantial subject of study. The member of the Service in receipt of these fellowships will be entitled to receive the full value of the fellowship, in addition to his leave salary, in terms of rule 10 (2)(e) of the AIS (Study Leave) Regulations, 1960. However, all such cases where the members of the Service, who have been awarded these fellowship and are being considered for grant of study leave, should be referred to the Government of India for approval. State Governments may grant study leave for these fellowships when pursued in India.\\n\\n(No.11019/5/99—AIS (III) dated 19.2.99 to Chief Secretaries of all States/Uts)\\n\\n2.

Attention is also invited to Rule 10 of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968, which provides that no member of the Service shall, except with the previous sanction of the Government or of such authority as may be empowered in this behalf, ask for, or accept contributions to or otherwise associate himself with the raising of any fund or other collections in cash or kind in pursuance of any objective whatsoever.\\n\\nIn this respect, a few cases have come to the notice of this Department wherein 4. members of the Service have negotiated/taken financial assistance from private bodies and other domestic organizations, not known to sponsor study programmes, for financing their study programmes, without the previous knowledge of the Government, thereby violating the provisions of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules as well as the All India Services (Study leave) Regulations and the instructions issued thereunder. Further, the fact of negotiating with these organizations was concealed while applying for leave.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIt has, therefore, been decided that-\\n\\n(a) No application for study leave or leave for study purposes shall be entertained unless the member of Service furnishes clear information on expenditure (including travel, hospitality etc.), sources of funding and details of agencies bearing funding.\\n\\n(b) No member of the Service shall negotiate for financial assistance from any institution (other than the one under which he/she intends and is permitted to pursue study) without the prior approval of the Government.

No.l1020/20/77-AIS(III) dated 26th October, 1977, are reiterated for strict compliance by all the sponsoring authorities as well as members of the All India Services:\\n\\ninstructions, as contained\\n\\nthe Departments\\n\\nin\\n\\n(i) Applications seeking admission to grant of study leave for pursuing higher studies abroad should be forwarded to the respective Cadre Controlling Authorities at least 2 months before the commencement of study leave/leave for study purposes.\\n\\n(ii) Before forwarding applications for grant of study leave to the respective Cadre Controlling Authorities, the State Governments should satisfy themselves that the applicants fulfill the conditions of eligibility laid down in the AIS(Study Leave) Regulations, 1960.\\n\\n(iii) The requisite information/copies of the documents, as mentioned in the Check-\\n\\nlist (Copy enclosed) should be invariably provided.\\n\\n(iv) Members of\\n\\nthe Services concerned and\\n\\nthe sponsoring Governments, Administrative Ministries/Departments should not presume the sanction of study leave.\\n\\n(v) Applicants should not make any preparations for journey etc. in anticipation of sanction of study leave to avoid frustration. They will do so only at their risk.\\n\\nThe same procedure should also be adopted for extension of ex-India study\\n\\n4. leave/other kind of leave in continuation of ex-India study leave.\\n\\n54\\n\\nThe contents of this letter may be brought to the notice of all members of the All\\n\\n5. India Services.\\n\\nCopy of the letter No.11020/03/2014-AIS-IIIdated 01/09/2014 addressed to the Chief Secretaries of all States/Union Territories\\n\\nSubject: Execution of Bond for availing Study Leave under Rule 9(i) of the AIS (Study\\n\\nLeave) Regulations, 1960\\n\\n\\n\\nregarding.\\n\\nI am directed to refer to the provisions of Rule 9(i) of the AIS (Study Leave) Regulations, 1960, which mandates every member of the Service who has been granted Study Leave or extension of such leave shall be required to execute a bond as given in Appendix ‘A’ or Appendix ‘A.I’.\\n\\n2. The said Bond executed by member of the Service requires putting in specified period of service after expiry of the Study Leave as prescribed by provisions of rule 9(2) of the said rules.\\n\\n3. It has come to the notice of this Department that the provisions of the aforesaid bond are being circumvented and officers who have availed Study Leave proceed on prolonged spells of leave due and admissible to them and thus do not put in active service for the requisite period as indicated in the bond executed by them.\\n\\n4. In view of the above, the provisions of the prescribed format of the Bond have been reviewed and decided to revise the Bond format. A copy of revised Bond is enclosed. All the Ministries/Departments/State Governments are requested to ensure that the necessary Bond in respect of grant of Study Leave under the AIS (Study Leave) Regulations, 1960 may henceforth be obtained in the revised formats.\\n\\nThe contents of this letter may be brought to the notice of all the members of the\\n\\n5. All India Services.\\n\\n55\", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': '/Users/saumya/Desktop/Programming/Data extraction/text/AllPDF/PdFextract copy 4/files/AIS(Study Leave)Regulations1950_NLTK.pdf'}, lookup_index=0)]"
