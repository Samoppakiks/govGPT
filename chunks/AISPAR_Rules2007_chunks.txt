Examples of such contribution may be the successful organization of a major event like the Kumbh Mela or successful conclusion of an activity that has been going on for a long time, or even successful dealing of an emergency (e.g. major earth quake/flood) would certainly be an exceptional contribution.3.7 The officer reported upon is required to indicate specific areas in which he/she feels the need to upgrade skills and attend training programs.He/she should also mention the specific steps that he/she has taken or proposes to take to upgrade his/her skills in the identified area.3.8 There is an increased emphasis on competency building in the new performance appraisal and career progression system.There would be a premium on competency and skill upgradation.

Chunk 54:
Hence, all officers are advised, through a note in Section Il, to keep the cadre controlling authority informed, at least once in five years, of all educational and training programs attended, including the details of marks/grades secured in such programs, details of professional papers published.These would be taken into account in the future career progression.3.9 This Section also requires the officer reported upon to record certain certificates about submission of property returns, annual medical check up and setting up of annual work plan for whom he/she would be the reporting authority.4.

Chunk 55:
Section-lll 4.1 Section Ill requires the reporting authority to comment on Section II as filled out by the officer reported upon, and specifically state whether he/she agrees with the responses relating to the accomplishments.In case of disagreement the reporting authority should highlight the specific portions with which he/she is unable to agree and the reasons for such disagreement.42 This Section then requires the reporting authority to comment on the skill upgradation needs as identified by the officer.43 Thereafter, this Section requires the reporting authority to record a numerical grade in respect of the workout put of the officer reported upon both in respect of the planned work as well as the unforeseen tasks.

Chunk 56:
A numerical grade is also required in respect of the “quality” of the output.In doing so, the reporting authority should take into account the costs incurred (whether the officer reported upon has been cost conscious), the time taken and whether the laid down tules/procedures have been adhered to in accomplishing the tasks.21 44 The reporting authority is also required to record a numerical grade in respect of work output, personal attributes and functional competencies.45 Section Ill requires the reporting authority to comment on the integrity of the officer reported upon.

Chunk 57:
In recording remarks with regard to integrity, he/she need not limit him/herself only to matters relating to financial integrity but could also take into account the moral and intellectual integrity of the officer reported upon.The following procedure should be followed in filling up the column relating to integrity: (i) If the Officer's integrity is beyond doubt, it may be stated. (ii) If there is any doubt or suspicion, the column should be left blank and action taken as under: (a) A separate secret note should be recorded and followed up.A copy of the note should also be sent together with the Performance Appraisal Report to the next superior officer who will ensure that the follow up action is taken expeditiously.

Chunk 58:
Where it is not possible either to certify the integrity or to record the secret note, the Reporting Officer should state either that he/she had not watched the officer's work for sufficient time to form a definite judgement or that he/she has heard nothing against the officer, as the case may be. (b) If, as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are cleared, the officer's integrity should be certified and an entry made accordingly in the Performance Appraisal Report. (c) If the doubts or suspicions are confirmed, this fact should also be recorded and duly communicated to the officer concerned. (

Chunk 59:
d) If as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are neither cleared nor confirmed, the officers conduct should be watched for a further period and thereafter action taken as indicated at (b) and (c) above.46 The reporting authority is also required to record a descriptive pen-picture on the overall qualities of the officer reported upon and his/her performance including his attitude towards weaker sections.This need not exceed about 100 words and should try to cover overall qualities of the officer including areas of strengths and lesser strengths.The pen-picture is also meant to be a qualitative supplement to the quantitative assessments made earlier part of this section.47 Reporting authority is then required to make recommendations relating to domain assignment.

Chunk 60:
The list of domains is at para 10.48 Finally, the reporting authority is required to record an overall grade.This should also be done on a scale of 1-10, with 1 referring to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.5.Section-IV 5.1 "This Section is to be filled up by the reviewing authority.He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the assessments made by the reporting officer.In case of disagreement, he/she may record his/her own assessment against the work output or any of the attributes in the column specifically provided for the purpose.In case of agreement, he/she need not fill in the column meant for him/her in the attributes/work output tables.Finally, the reviewing authority is required to record an overall grade in the scale of 1-10.6.

Chunk 62:
It is expected that any grading of 1 or 2 (against work output or attributes or overall grade) would be adequately justified in the pen-picture by way of specific failures and similarly, any grade of 9 or 10 would be justified with respect to specific accomplishments.Grades of 1-2 or 9-10 are expected to be rare occurrences and hence the need to justify them.In awarding a numerical grade the reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities should rate the officer against a larger population of his/her peers that may be currently working under them or would have worked under them in the past.7.2 Weightage & Mean Weights have been assigned to work output, personal attributes and functional competency.

Chunk 63:
The overall grade will be based on the addition of the mean value of each group of indicators in proportion to weightage assigned.8.Disclosure 8.1 There should be more openness in the system of appraisal.The annual PAR, including the overall grade and integrity, should be communicated to the officer reported upon after it has been finalized by the accepting authority.8.2.Representation The officer reported upon may have the option to give his comments on the PAR.Such comments may be restricted to the specific factual observations contained in the Performance Appraisal Report leading to the assessment of the officer in terms of attributes, competency and output.

Signature of Accepting Authority 47 24General guidelines for filling up the Performance Appraisal Report form for the Indian Administrative Service officers who are on deputation under clause (i) and (ii) of sub-rule (2) of rule 6 of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 1.Introduction 18६ The Performance Appraisal Report is an important document.It provides the basic and vital inputs for further development of an officer.The officer reported upon, the Reporting Authority, the Reviewing Authority and the Accepting Authority should, therefore, undertake the duty of filling up the form with a high sense of responsibility.1.2 Performance appraisal should be used as a tool for career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental exercise.

Chunk 120:
Reporting Authorities should realize that the objective is to develop an officer so that he/she realizes his/her true potential.It is not meant to be a faultfinding process but a developmental tool.The Reporting Authority, the Reviewing Authority and the Accepting Authority should not shy away from reporting shortcomings in performance, attitudes or overall personality of the officer reported upon.1.3 The columns should be filled with due care and attention and after devoting adequate time.Any attempt to fill the report in a casual or superficial manner will be easily discernible to the higher authorities.

Chunk 121:
14 Although the actual documentation of performance appraisal is a year-end exercise, in order that it may be a tool for human resource development, career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental exercise, the Reporting Authority and the officer reported upon should meet during the course of the year at regular intervals to review the performance and to take necessary corrective steps.2.Section-I 2.1 This Section should be filled up in the Administration Division/Personnel Deptt.Period of report could either be the entire reporting year, namely, from 12 of April to 31st March or a part of the year (exceeding 3 months).In case the period of report is a full year, it should be indicated accordingly; for example, 2007-2008.

Chunk 122:
In case the period of report is less than the entire year, specific start and end dates should be indicated, for example, 100 September 2007 - 31st March 2008.2.2 Information on the present grade (pay-scale) as well as present post (actual designation and organization) and the date from which he/she has been on his/her present post needs to be mentioned.2.3 In the table relating to reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities the name and designation of the reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities should be mentioned so that the officer reported upon is clear about whom he/she is required to send the report to.24 The period of absence from duty, on leave, training, or for other reasons, should also be mentioned in this section in the table provided for the purpose.

Chunk 123:
Details of the training attended date of filing of property returns and whether the officer reported upon has reported/reviewed should be mentioned in the table for the purpose and annual performance report of all his/her subordinate officers for the previous year.25 2This Section provides for regular annual medical examination.The health check is mandatory for all officers above the age of 40 and may be totally dispensed for with officers below the age of 40, except in case of medical incident.A copy of the summary of the medical report is to be attached to the PAR Form by the Admin./Personnel Department.

Chunk 124:
The format of the health check up and the summary of medical report will be as circulated by the Cadre Controlling Authority, after consultation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.3.Section-Il 31 The officer reported upon is first required to give brief description of his/her duties and responsibilities, which would normally not exceed about 100 words.Ideally, this should be in bullet form.24 Substituted vide Notification No.11059/09/2006-AIS-III dated 31.03.2008 published in GSR No.256(E) dt.31.03.2008 2 Substituted vide Notification No.11059/09/2006-AIS-III dated 31.03.2008 published in GSR No.256(E) dt.31.03.2008 48 3.2 All officers are required to develop a work plan for the year and agree upon the same with the reporting officer.

Chunk 125:
The work plan should incorporate the relative annual work rhythm and budgetary cycle.This exercise is to be carried out at the beginning of the year and finalized by 300 April, positively.In case of a change of the reporting officer during the year, the work plan agreed with the previous reporting officer would continue to apply.The work plan agreed upon at the beginning of the year has to be reviewed again during the month of September/October as a mid-year exercise and finalized by 31st October.Based on this review the work plan may undergo some changes from that originally prepared.3.3 After the work plan is prepared, it is possible that the officer reported upon is transferred out.There need not be more than one work plan for one post each year.

Chunk 126:
The period spent by the officer during the year and his contribution could be considered for evaluating his performance against the work plan.In the case of mid-term transfers, continuity and assessment of work and the lower performance profile in the first quarter should be taken into consideration.3.4 The work plans, duly signed by the officer reported upon and the reporting authority has to be submitted to the reviewing authority for his/her perusal and custody.The performance appraisal form provides for an assessment of the accomplishments vis-a-vis the work plan agreed at the commencement of the year and reviewed mid- year.The officer reported upon is required to fill up the table provided for the purpose in Section-ll.

Chunk 127:
3.5 It is not necessary that the work plan should be entirely quantitative in nature.While for field level posts, the work plan would consist essentially of quantifiable targets, for secretarial level posts it would consist of policy objectives to be achieved etc.4.Section-lll 4.1 The reporting authority is required to record a numerical grade in respect of certain attributes and work output.42 This Section requires the reporting authority to record a numerical grade in respect of the work output of the officer reported upon both in respect of the planned work as well as the unforeseen tasks.A numerical grade is also required in respect of the “quality” of the output.

Chunk 128:
In doing so, the reporting authority should take into account the costs incurred (whether the officer reported upon has been cost conscious), the time taken and whether the laid down tules/procedures have been adhered to in accomplishing the tasks.43 Section Ill requires the reporting authority to comment on the integrity of the officer reported upon.In recording remarks with regard to integrity, he/she need not limit him/herself only to matters relating to financial integrity but could also take into account the moral and intellectual integrity of the officer reported upon.The following procedure should be followed in filling up the column relating to integrity: (i) If the Officer's integrity is beyond doubt, it may be stated. (

Chunk 129:
ii) If there is any doubt or suspicion, the column should be left blank and action taken as under: (a) A separate secret note should be recorded and followed up.A copy of the note should also be sent together with the Performance Appraisal Report to the next superior officer who will ensure that the follow up action is taken expeditiously.Where it is not possible either to certify the integrity or to record the secret note, the Reporting Officer should state either that he/she had not watched the officer's work for sufficient time to form a definite judgement or that he/she has heard nothing against the officer, as the case may be. (

Chunk 130:
b) If, as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are cleared, the officer's integrity should be certified and an entry made accordingly in the Performance Appraisal Report. (c) If the doubts or suspicions are confirmed, this fact should also be recorded and duly communicated to the officer concerned. (d) If as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are neither cleared nor confirmed, the officers conduct should be watched for a further period and thereafter action taken as indicated at (b) and (c) above.49 44 The reporting authority is also required to record a descriptive pen-picture on the overall qualities of the officer reported upon and his/her performance including areas of strengths and lesser strengths.

Chunk 131:
This need not exceed about 100 words and should try to cover overall qualities of the officer including areas of strengths and lesser strengths.The pen-picture is also meant to be a qualitative supplement to the quantitative assessments made earlier part of this section.45 The reporting authority is then required to make recommendations relating to domain assignment.The list of domains is at para 9.46 Finally, the reporting authority is required to record an overall grade.This should also be done on a scale of 1-10, with 1 referring to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.5.Section-IV 5.1 2This Section is to be filled up by the reviewing authority.He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the assessments made by the reporting officer.

Chunk 132:
In case of disagreement, he/she may record his/her own assessment against the work output or any of the attributes in the column specifically provided for the purpose.In case of agreement, he/she need not fill in the column meant for him/her in the attributes/work output tables.Finally, the reviewing authority is required to record an overall grade in the scale of 1-10.6.Section-V 6.1 This Section is to be filled by the accepting authority.He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the assessments made by the reporting authority/reviewing authorities.

Chunk 133:
In case of difference of opinion, he/she is required to give details and reasons for the same in the column specifically provided for the purpose in the table in Section V. if Numerical Grades 71 At several places, numerical grades are to be awarded by reporting and review authorities.These should be ona scale of 1-10, where 1 refers to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.It is expected that any grading of 1 or 2 (against work output or attributes or overall grade) would be adequately justified in the pen-picture by way of specific failures and similarly, any grade of 9 or 10 would be justified with respect to specific accomplishments.Grades of 1-2 or 9-10 are expected to be rare occurrences and hence the need to justify them.

Chunk 134:
In awarding a numerical grade the reporting and reviewing authorities should rate the officer against a larger population of his/her peers that may be currently working under them or would have worked under them in the past.72 Weightage & Mean Weights have been assigned to attributes and work output.The overall grade will be based on the addition of the mean value of each group of indicators/descriptive picture in proportion to weightage assigned.8.Schedule for completion of PARs of IAS Officers The completed PAR should reach the Cadre Controlling Authorities by 319 March the following year.The Cadre Controlling Authority will prepare a list of PARs not received and follow up with the concerned organisations.9.

14 Although the actual documentation of performance appraisal is a year-end exercise, in order that it may be a tool for human resource development, career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental exercise, the Reporting Authority and the officer reported upon should meet during the course of the year at regular intervals to review the performance and to take necessary corrective steps.Instructions on filling up the different sections 2.Section-I 21 This Section should be filled up in the Administration Division/Home Deptt.Period of report could either be the entire reporting year, namely, from 13 of April to 31st March or a part of the year (exceeding 3 months).In case the period of report is a full year, it should be indicated accordingly; for example, 2007-2008. ॥

Chunk 157:
case the period of report is less than the entire year, specific start and end dates should be indicated, for example, 100 September 2007 - 31st March 2008.2.2 nformation on the present grade (pay-scale) as well as present post (actual designation and organization) and the date from which he/she has been on his/her present post needs to be mentioned.2.3 n the table relating to reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities the name and designation of the reporting and reviewing authorities should be mentioned so that the officer reported upon is clear about whom he/she is required to send the report.2.4 The period of absence from duty, on leave, training, or for other reasons, should also be mentioned in this section in the table provided for the purpose.

Chunk 158:
Details of the training attended, date of filing of property returns and whether the officer reported upon has reported/reviewed and the annual performance report of all his/her subordinate officers for the previous year should be mentioned in the table for the purpose.25 This Section provides for regular annual medical examination.The health check is mandatory for all Indian Police Service officers.A copy of the summary of medical report is to be attached to the PAR Form by the Admin./Home Department.The format for health check up and the summary of medical report will be as circulated by the Cadre Controlling Authority, after consultation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.3.

Chunk 159:
Section-Il 3.1 The officer reported upon is first required to give brief description of his/her duties and responsibilities, which would normally not exceed about 100 words.Ideally, this should be in bullet form.3.2 All officers are required to develop a work plan for the year and agree upon the same with the reporting officer.The work plan should incorporate the relative annual work rhythm and budgetary cycle.This exercise is to be carried out at the beginning of the year and finalized by 300 April, positively.In case of a change of the reporting officer during the year, the work plan agreed with the previous reporting officer would continue to apply.

Chunk 160:
The work plan agreed 62 upon at the beginning of the year has to be reviewed again during the month of September/October as a mid-year exercise and finalized by 31st October.Based on this review the work plan may undergo some changes from that originally prepared.3.3 After the work plan is prepared, it is possible that the officer reported upon is transferred out.There need not be more than one work plan for one post each year.The period spent by the officer during the year and his contribution could be considered for evaluating his performance against the work plan.In the case of mid-term transfers, continuity and assessment of work and the lower performance profile in the first quarter should be taken into consideration.

Chunk 161:
3.4 The work plans, duly signed by the officer reported upon and the reporting authority has to be submitted to the reviewing authority for his/her perusal and custody.The performance appraisal form provides for an assessment of the accomplishments vis-a-vis the work plan agreed at the commencement of the year and reviewed mid- year.The officer reported upon is required to fill up the table provided for the purpose in Section-ll.3.5 It is not necessary that the work plan should be entirely quantitative in nature.While for field level posts, the work plan would consist essentially of quantifiable targets, for secretarial level posts it would consist of policy objectives to be achieved etc.

Chunk 162:
3.6 Section II also provides an opportunity for the officer to reflect upon his/her performance during the year and indicate one item which he/she thought was a significant contributions made by him/her during the year.It is always possible for any officer to make significant contribution even in activities otherwise regarded as routine in nature.Examples of such contribution may be the successful organization of a major event like the Kumbh Mela or successful conclusion of an activity that has been going on for a long time, or even successful dealing of an emergency (e.g. major earth quake/flood) would certainly be an exceptional contribution.3.7 The officer reported upon is required to indicate specific areas in which he/she feels the need to upgrade skills and attend training programs.

Chunk 163:
He/she should also mention the specific steps that he/she has taken or proposes to take to upgrade his/her skills in the identified area.3.8 There is an increased emphasis on competency building in the new performance appraisal and career progression system.There would be a premium on competency and skill upgradation.Hence, all officers are advised, through a note in Section Il, to keep the cadre controlling authority informed, at least once in five years, of all educational and training programs attended, including the details of marks/grades secured in such programs, details of professional papers published.These would be taken into account in the future career progression.

Chunk 164:
3.9 This Section also requires the officer reported upon to record certain certificates about submission of property returns, annual medical check up and setting up of annual work plan for whom he/she would be the reporting authority.4.Section-lll 4.1 Section Ill requires the reporting authority to comment on Section II as filled out by the officer reported upon, and specifically state whether he/she agrees with the responses relating to the accomplishments.In case of disagreement the reporting authority should highlight the specific portions with which he/she is unable to agree and the reasons for such disagreement.42 This Section then requires the reporting authority to comment on the skill upgradation needs as identified by the officer.

Chunk 165:
43 Thereafter, this Section requires the reporting authority to record a numerical grade in respect of the workout put of the officer reported upon both in respect of the planned work as well as the unforeseen tasks.A numerical grade is also required in respect of the “quality” of the output.In doing so, the reporting authority should take into account the costs incurred (whether the officer reported upon has been cost conscious), the time taken and whether the laid down tules/procedures have been adhered to in accomplishing the tasks.44 The reporting authority is also required to record a numerical grade in respect of work output, personal attributes and functional competencies.63 45 Section Ill requires the reporting authority to comment on the integrity of the officer reported upon.

Chunk 166:
In recording remarks with regard to integrity, he/she need not limit him/herself only to matters relating to financial integrity but could also take into account the moral and intellectual integrity of the officer reported upon.The following procedure should be followed in filling up the column relating to integrity: (i) If the Officer's integrity is beyond doubt, it may be stated. (ii) If there is any doubt or suspicion, the column should be left blank and action taken as under: (a) A separate secret note should be recorded and followed up.A copy of the note should also be sent together with the Performance Appraisal Report to the next superior officer who will ensure that the follow up action is taken expeditiously.

Chunk 167:
Where it is not possible either to certify the integrity or to record the secret note, the Reporting Officer should state either that he/she had not watched the officer's work for sufficient time to form a definite judgement or that he/she has heard nothing against the officer, as the case may be. (b) If, as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are cleared, the officer's integrity should be certified and an entry made accordingly in the Performance Appraisal Report. (c) If the doubts or suspicions are confirmed, this fact should also be recorded and duly communicated to the officer concerned. (

Chunk 168:
d) If as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are neither cleared nor confirmed, the officers conduct should be watched for a further period and thereafter action taken as indicated at (b) and (c) above.46 The reporting authority is also required to record a descriptive pen-picture on the overall qualities of the officer reported upon and his/her performance including his attitude towards weaker sections.This need not exceed about 100 words and should try to cover overall qualities of the officer including areas of strengths and lesser strengths.The pen-picture is also meant to be a qualitative supplement to the quantitative assessments made earlier part of this section.47 Reporting authority is then required to make recommendations relating to domain assignment.4.8.

Chunk 169:
Finally, the reporting authority is required to record an overall grade.This should also be done on a scale of 1-10, with 1 referring to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.5.Section-IV 5.1 This Section is to be filled up by the reviewing authority.He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the assessments made by the reporting officer.In case of disagreement, he/she may record his/her own assessment against the work output or any of the attributes in the column specifically provided for the purpose.In case of agreement, he/she need not fill in the column meant for him/her in the attributes/work output tables.Finally he/she is required to record an overall grade in the scale of 1-10.6.Section-V 6.1 This Section is to be filled by the accepting authority.

Chunk 170:
He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the assessments made by the reporting authority/reviewing authorities.In case of difference of opinion, he/she is required to give details and reasons for the same in the column specifically provided for the purpose in the table in Section V. 7.Numerical Grades 71 At several places, numerical grades are to be awarded by reporting and review authorities.These should be ona scale of 1-10, where 1 refers to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.It is expected that any grading of 1 or 2 (against work output or attributes or overall grade) would be adequately justified in the pen-picture by way of specific failures and similarly, any grade of 9 or 10 would be justified with respect to specific accomplishments.

Chunk 171:
Grades of 1-2 or 9-10 are expected to be rare occurrences and hence the need to justify them.In awarding a numerical grade the reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities should rate the officer against a larger population of his/her peers that may be currently working under them or would have worked under them in the past.64 7.2 Weightage & Mean Weights have been assigned to work output, personal attributes and functional competency.The overall grade will be based on the addition of the mean value of each group of indicators in proportion to weightage assigned.8.Disclosure 8.1 There should be more openness in the system of appraisal.

Chunk 172:
The annual PAR, including the overall grade and integrity, should be communicated to the officer reported upon after it has been finalized by the accepting authority.8.2.Representation The officer reported upon may have the option to give his comments on the PAR.Such comments may be restricted to the specific factual observations contained in the Performance Appraisal Report leading to the assessment of the officer in terms of attributes, competency and output.If comments are submitted, the Reporting/Reviewing/Accepting Authority would have the option to accept them and modify the PAR accordingly.If the comments are not accepted, the views of the Reporting/Reviewing/Accepting Authority would be communicated with reasons to the officer reported upon.

Chunk 173:
Thereafter, only if the officer reported upon so desires, he may request for the matter to be forwarded to the Referral Board.The representation shall be confined to errors of facts and nothing else.The Referral Board shall give clear findings on the representation and take a final decision on the assessment, including the overall grading in regard to the parameters affected thereby.The decision along with details in case an entry is upgraded or down graded with, reasons for same may be recorded in the PAR and the same communicated to the officer reported upon.The decision of the Referral Board shall be final.9.

Chunk 216:
Reporting Authorities should realize that the objective is to develop an officer so that he/she realizes his/her true potential.It is not meant to be a faultfinding process but a developmental tool.The Reporting Authority, the Reviewing Authority and the Accepting Authority should not shy away from reporting shortcomings in performance, attitudes or overall personality of the officer reported upon.1.3 The columns should be filled with due care and attention and after devoting adequate time.Any attempt to fill the report in a casual or superficial manner will be easily discernible to the higher authorities.

Chunk 217:
14 Although the actual documentation of performance appraisal is a year-end exercise, in order that it may be a tool for human resource development, career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental exercise, the Reporting Authority and the officer reported upon should meet during the course of the year at regular intervals to review the performance and to take necessary corrective steps.Instructions on filling up the different sections 2.Section-I 2.1 This Section should be filled up in the Administration Division/Home Deptt.Period of report could either be the entire reporting year, namely, from 14 of April to 319 March or a part of the year (exceeding 3 months).In case the period of report is a full year, it should be indicated accordingly; for example, 2007-2008.

Chunk 223:
The reporting authority is required to record a numerical grade in respect of certain attributes and work output.4.2.This Section requires the reporting authority to record a numerical grade in respect of the work output of the officer reported upon both in respect of the planned work as well as the unforeseen tasks.A numerical grade is also required in respect of the “quality” of the output.In doing so, the reporting authority should take into account the costs incurred (whether the officer reported upon has been cost conscious), the time taken and whether the laid down tules/procedures have been adhered to in accomplishing the tasks.4.3.Section || requires the reporting authority to comment on the integrity of the officer reported upon.

Chunk 224:
In recording remarks with regard to integrity, he/she need not limit him/herself only to matters relating to financial integrity 80 but could also take into account the moral and intellectual integrity of the officer reported upon.The following procedure should be followed in filling up the column relating to integrity: (i) If the Officer's integrity is beyond doubt, it may be stated. (ii) If there is any doubt or suspicion, the column should be left blank and action taken as under: (a) A separate secret note should be recorded and followed up.A copy of the note should also be sent together with the Performance Appraisal Report to the next superior officer who will ensure that the follow up action is taken expeditiously.

Chunk 225:
Where it is not possible either to certify the integrity or to record the secret note, the Reporting Officer should state either that he/she had not watched the officer's work for sufficient time to form a definite judgement or that he/she has heard nothing against the officer, as the case may be. (b) If, as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are cleared, the officer's integrity should be certified and an entry made accordingly in the Performance Appraisal Report.

Chunk 229:
It is expected that any grading of 1 or 2 (against work output or attributes or overall grade) would be adequately justified in the pen-picture by way of specific failures and similarly, any grade of 9 or 10 would be justified with respect to specific accomplishments.Grades of 1-2 or 9-10 are expected to be rare occurrences and hence the need to justify them.In awarding a numerical grade the reporting and reviewing authorities should rate the officer against a larger population of his/her peers that may be currently working under them or would have worked under them in the past.81 7.2 Weightage & Mean Weights have been assigned to attributes and work output.

Chunk 230:
The overall grade will be based on the addition of the mean value of each group of indicators/descriptive picture in proportion to weightage assigned.8.Schedule for completion of PARs of Indian Police Service Officers The completed PAR should reach the Cadre Controlling Authorities by 318 March the following year.The Cadre Controlling Authority will prepare a list of PARs not received and follow up with the concerned organisations.82 Form IIIA [See rule 4] The All India Services (Performance Appraisal Report) Rules, 2007 PERFORMANCE REPORT ON STUDY LEAVE/LEAVE FOR STUDY (Applicable for Indian Police Service Officers) (For the year/period ending ) A.

It is expected that any grading of 1 or 2 (against work output or attributes or overall grade) would be adequately justified in the pen-picture by way of specific failures and similarly, any grade of 9 or 10 would be justified with respect to specific accomplishments.Grades of 1-2 93 or 9-10 are expected to be rare occurrences and hence the need to justify them.In awarding a numerical grade the reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities should rate the officer against a larger population of his/her peers that may be currently working under them or would have worked under them in the past.7.2 Weightage & Mean Weights have been assigned to work output, personal attributes and functional competency.

Chunk 261:
The overall grade will be based on the addition of the mean value of each group of indicators in proportion to weightage assigned.8.Disclosure 8.1 There should be more openness in the system of appraisal.The annual PAR, including the overall grade and integrity, should be communicated to the officer reported upon after it has been finalized by the accepting authority.8.2.Representation The officer reported upon may have the option to give his comments on the PAR.Such comments may be restricted to the specific factual observations contained in the Performance Appraisal Report leading to the assessment of the officer in terms of attributes, competency and output.

Chunk 280:
14 Although the actual documentation of performance appraisal is a year-end exercise, in order that it may be a tool for human resource development, career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental exercise, the Reporting Authority and the officer reported upon should meet during the course of the year at regular intervals to review the performance and to take necessary corrective steps.2.Section-I 2.1 This Section should be filled up in the Administration Division/Environment & Forest Department.Period of report could either be the entire reporting year, namely, from 1301 April to 31st March or a part of the year (exceeding 3 months).In case the period of report is a full year, it should be indicated accordingly; for example, 2007-2008.

The work plan agreed upon at the beginning of the year has to be reviewed again during the month of September/October as a mid-year exercise and finalized by 31st October.Based on this review the work plan may undergo some changes from that originally prepared.33 After the work plan is prepared, it is possible that the officer reported upon is transferred out.There need not be more than one work plan for one post each year.The period spent by the officer during the year and his contribution could be considered for evaluating his performance against the work plan.In the case of mid-term transfers, continuity and assessment of work and the lower performance profile in the first quarter should be taken into consideration.

Chunk 313:
3.4 The work plans, duly signed by the officer reported upon and the reporting authority has to be submitted to the reviewing authority for his/her perusal and custody.The performance appraisal form provides for an assessment of the accomplishments vis-a-vis the work plan agreed at the commencement of the year and reviewed mid- year.The officer reported upon is required to fill up the table provided for the purpose in Section-ll.3.5 It is not necessary that the work plan should be entirely quantitative in nature.While for field level posts, the work plan would consist essentially of quantifiable targets, for secretarial level posts it would consist of policy objectives to be achieved etc.4.

Chunk 314:
Section-lll 4.1 The reporting authority is required to record a numerical grade in respect of certain attributes and work output.42 This Section requires the reporting authority to record a numerical grade in respect of the work output of the officer reported upon both in respect of the planned work as well as the unforeseen tasks.A numerical grade is also required in respect of the “quality” of the output.In doing so, the reporting authority should take into account the costs incurred (whether the officer reported upon has been cost conscious), the time taken and whether the laid down tules/procedures have been adhered to in accomplishing the tasks.43 Section Ill requires the reporting authority to comment on the integrity of the officer reported upon.

Chunk 315:
In recording remarks with regard to integrity, he/she need not limit him/herself only to matters relating to financial integrity but could also take into account the moral and intellectual integrity of the officer reported upon.The following procedure should be followed in filling up the column relating to integrity: (i) If the Officer's integrity is beyond doubt, it may be stated.110 (ii) If there is any doubt or suspicion, the column should be left blank and action taken as under: (a) A separate secret note should be recorded and followed up.A copy of the note should also be sent together with the Performance Appraisal Report to the next superior officer who will ensure that the follow up action is taken expeditiously.

Chunk 316:
Where it is not possible either to certify the integrity or to record the secret note, the Reporting Officer should state either that he/she had not watched the officer's work for sufficient time to form a definite judgement or that he/she has heard nothing against the officer, as the case may be. (b) If, as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are cleared, the officer's integrity should be certified and an entry made accordingly in the Performance Appraisal Report. (c) If the doubts or suspicions are confirmed, this fact should also be recorded and duly communicated to the officer concerned. (

Chunk 317:
d) If as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are neither cleared nor confirmed, the officers conduct should be watched for a further period and thereafter action taken as indicated at (b) and (c) above.44 The reporting authority is also required to record a descriptive pen-picture on the overall qualities of the officer reported upon and his/her performance including areas of strengths and lesser strengths.This need not exceed about 100 words and should try to cover overall qualities of the officer including areas of strengths and lesser strengths.The pen-picture is also meant to be a qualitative supplement to the quantitative assessments made earlier part of this section.

Chunk 318:
45 The reporting authority is then required to make recommendations relating to domain assignment.The list of domains is at para 9.46 Finally, the reporting authority is required to record an overall grade.This should also be done on a scale of 1-10, with 1 referring to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.5.Section-IV 5.1 This Section is to be filled up by the reviewing authority.He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the assessments made by the reporting officer.In case of disagreement, he/she may record his/her own assessment against the work output or any of the attributes in the column specifically provided for the purpose.In case of agreement, he/she need not fill in the column meant for him/her in the attributes/work output tables.

Chunk 319:
Finally, the reviewing authority is required to record an overall grade in the scale of 1-10.6.Section-V 6.1 This Section is to be filled by the accepting authority.He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the assessments made by the reporting authority/reviewing authorities.In case of difference of opinion, he/she is required to give details and reasons for the same in the column specifically provided for the purpose in the table in Section V. 7.Numerical Grades rg At several places, numerical grades are to be awarded by reporting and reviewing authorities.These should be on a scale of 1-10, where 1 refers to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.

Chunk 320:
It is expected that any grading of 1 or 2 (against work output or attributes or overall grade) would be adequately justified in the pen-picture by way of specific failures and similarly, any grade of 9 or 10 would be justified with respect to specific accomplishments.Grades of 1-2 or 9-10 are expected to be rare occurrences and hence the need to justify them.In awarding a numerical grade the reporting and reviewing authorities should rate the officer against a larger population of his/her peers that may be currently working under them or would have worked under them in the past.7.2 Weightage & Mean Weights have been assigned to attributes and work output.

Chunk 321:
The overall grade will be based on the addition of the mean value of each group of indicators/descriptive picture in proportion to weightage assigned.111 8.Schedule for completion of PARs of Indian Forest Service Officers The completed PAR should reach the Cadre Controlling Authorities by 319 March the following year.The Cadre Controlling Authority will prepare a list of PARs not received and follow up with the concerned organisations.
