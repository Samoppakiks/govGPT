moS has the option to draw death-cum-retirement gratuity under the liberalised pension rules or under the old rules applicable to officers of the Central Services Class |: - The Government of India decided to give option to certain categories of officers to elect the old Rules by which they were governed previously of the pension rules as applicable to officers of the Central Services Class |. The following categories of officers were accordingly given the option indicated against them. The option was to be exercised in writing and communicated to the Accounts Officer within the stipulated time-limit. The option once exercised was final. The officers who elected to be governed by the pension rules as applicable to officers of the Central Services, Class-l, were subsequently brought under these Rules after they were promulgated. 2. The

Government of India have decided that, where death-cum-retirement gratuity has been drawn under the Liberalised Pension Rules by an officer who subsequently opted to be governed by the Old Pension Rules, the gratuity amount shall first be offset against any arrears of pension that may become due to him consequent on opting for Old Pension Rules. The remaining amount if any, may be recovered in one of the following methods. The officer concerned may also be given the option to elect for one of these two methods:- (i) the death-cum-retirement gratuity may be recovered in one lump-sum where this is possible or in such number of instalments as, in the opinion of the State Government will not put the officer to undue hardship subject to the condition that the number of such instalments does not exceed twelve. Where the amount is proposed to be recovered in instalments, a bond or other instrument may be taken from the officer 374 binding himself and his heirs to refund the excess of death-cum-retirement gratuity recoverable from him; (ii) the death-cum-retirement gratuity may be treated as the commuted value of pension and adjusted accordingly. This method will be applicable only to those officers who have not already commuted any portion of their pension or have commuted less than the permissible limit, viz., half of the annuity. Where an officer had already commuted to the extent of one-third and becomes eligible for commuting one-half pension consequent on opting for Old Pension Rules, he need not be subject to a further medical examination. In the case of officer, who had not commuted any portion of their pension earlier the gratuity recoverable from them should be treated as automatic commutation of pension and the revised rate of pension reduced by the pension equivalent of gratuity as on

They need to undergo medical examination only in case they desire to commute their pension further. The amount that may become admissible may then be set off against the amount of gratuity already received by the officers and the balance, if any, recovered in one instalment. 2.2.

Rule 30 of the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958, has replaced only the corresponding provisions in the Superior Civil Service Rules, the Civil Services Regulations etc. and not the Premature Retirement Rules. The above category of Indian Police Officers shall therefore, retain the right to retire under the Premature Retirement Rules. In case of retirement under Premature Retirement Rules the pension shall, however, be determined under those Rules, and not under the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958.

If a State Government issues such a certificate with reference to a cadre post having regard to the seniority of the officer, its validity cannot be questioned on the ground that the officer concerned never held such a post within the cadre or that there was no vacancy in the cadre during that period against which the certificate has been issued by the State Government.

moS on Central Deputation, who takes leave and retires at the end of leave, it may be deemed that he would have continued to officiate in the post in the Central Government before leave, but proceeding on such leave and accordingly his average emoluments should be determined for the purpose of calculation of retirement benefits: - A cases has arisen in which orders were issued by the Central Government reverting a member of an All India Service on deputation to the Central Government to his parent cadre, but instead of joining duty under the State Government the member of the Service gave three months notice to the State Government under sub-rule (2) of rule 16 of the All India Services (DCRB) Rules, 1958 and applied to the Central Government for grant of leave co-terminus with the period of notice. This leave was granted by the Central Government and the officer proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement and retired from service on the expiry of the leave. A question was raised as to the emoluments for this leave 379 period which should be taken into account for computing the average emoluments of this officer for the 10 months prior to the date of his retirement from service for determining the retirement benefits admissible to him. 2. The

Chunk 379:
matter has been carefully examined in consultation with the Ministry of Law, (Deptt. of Legal Affairs). The emoluments for the leave period in this case which should be taken into account for the purpose of computing the average emoluments of the last 10 months of the service should be determined in the manner laid down in Note 1 below rule 2(1)(aa) ibid In the present case though the Central Government had passed orders reverting the officer to his parent cadre, yet he did not assume charge of any post under the State Government and instead proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement sanctioned by the Central Government. Therefore, for the purpose of the above note, the emoluments for the leave period should be taken as what they would have been had he not been absent from duty from the post he was holding under the Central Government before the proceeded on such leave. 3. The

Chunk 380:
aforesaid Note 1 below rule 2(1)(aa) ibid provides a self-regulating procedure to determine the emoluments in such cases and does not call for the issue of the certificate either by the Central Government or by the State Government as to the emoluments which should be taken into account for computing the average emoluments in the circumstances mentioned in that Note. Keeping in view the position explained above, it has been decided that in the case of a member of an All India Services on deputation of the Central Government who takes leave in continuation of the deputation and retires at the end of the leave, it may be deemed that he would have continued to officiate in the post under the Central Government which he was holding immediately before proceeding on leave but for proceeding on such leave and accordingly his average emoluments should be determined for the purpose of calculation of retirement benefits. 5.

It

Chunk 402:
has been brought to the notice of this Ministry that in spite of this clarification provisional pension is not being authorised by some Heads of Officers where departmental/judicial proceedings are pending against a_ retiring Government servant. Since non-payment to such Government servants, and the Heads of Offices have no discretion in this matter, it is again emphasised that the provisional pension must be sanctioned in all such cases in accordance with the rules.

Chunk 403:
65 and 74 ibid inter-alia provide that the provisional pension in such cases should not exceed the maximum pension which would have been admissible on the basis of the qualifying service upto the date of retirement of the Government servant.

The matter has been considered and it has been decided that even in cases covered by the above mentioned mentioned rules 100 per cent pension, which is otherwise admissible to the Government servants should be authorised as provisional pension, as in cases of normal retirement. No gratuity shall however be paid at this stage. 3. The

regarding regulation of service of the moS from All India Service to autonomous bodies and vice versa: - | am directed to say that this Department have issued orders vide OM No.28/10/84-Pension Unit dated the 29" August, 1984 regarding counting of service rendered by a Central Government servant for pension when he moves from Central Government service to the service of a central autonomous body and vice versa. According to these orders, when a Central Government servant borne on a pensionable establishment is allowed to be absorbed in an autonomous body having a pension scheme, the service rendered by him under the Government shall be allowed to be counted towards pension under the autonomous body. Similarly, a person working under such an autonomous body joins government service, the service rendered by him under the autonomous will be counted as qualifying service for pension under the Government. The Government/autonomous body will discharge its pension liability by paying a lump sum amount, as a one time settlement, of pro-rata pension etc. to the Government or autonomous body as the case may be. An employee of autonomous body having CPF scheme on absorption under the Central Government will have an option either to receive CPF benefits which have accrued to him from the autonomous body — and start his service afresh under the Government or choose to count service rendered by him under that body as qualifying service for pension under the Government by foregoing employer's contribution with interest thereon, which will be payable to the Central Government Department concerned by the autonomous body. 2.

This

Chunk 504:
Department have considered the question of extending the above orders to members of All India Services. The case of a member of an all India Service permitted to get absorbed permanently in the service of a central autonomous body can be regulated under the provisions contained in rule 5 A of All India Services(DCRB) Rules, 1958. If

Chunk 505:
an employee of an autonomous body who joins service under the Central Government or a State Government and later on is appointed t an All India Service, his case can be regulated under the provisions contained in rule 8(2) ibid. Thus the case of an employee of an autonomous body who joins an All India Service direct is not covered under the rules and instructions issued by the Central Government. It has, therefore, been decided that the 394 case of an officer who was working under a central autonomous body, as defined in para 4 of this Department’s OM dated 29.8.

Chunk 506:
84 referred to above, before his appointment to an All India Service should be regulated as follows:- (a) The service rendered by an All India Service Officer, under a central autonomous body having a pension scheme, before his appointment to the Service, will be counted as qualifying for pension under the AIS(DCRB) Rules, 1958.

autonomous body will discharge its pension liability by paying a lump sum amount, as a one-time payment, equal to the pro-rata pension/service gratuitytterminal gratuity and the DCRG for the service rendered by him under them to the State Government on whose cadre the officer is borne. (b) An All India Service officer who has rendered service under a central autonomous body not having a pension scheme, before his appointment to the service, can exercise option either to receive contributory provident fund benefits which have accrued to him from the autonomous body and start his service afresh under Government or choose to count service rendered in that body as qualifying service for pension under Government by foregoing employer’s share of CPF contributions with interest thereon, which will be paid to the State Government concerned. The option shall be exercised within one year from the date of appointment to the All India Service. If no option is received within the stipulated period, the officer shall deemed to have opted to receive CPF benefits. The option once exercised or deemed to have exercise shall be final. 3. An

Chunk 508:
officer who was appointed to an All India Service prior to the date of issue of these orders but not yet retired from service, shall also be governed by these orders. Such an officer will have an option either:- a) Or b) To retain the pro-rata retirement and other benefits received by him from the autonomous body. In that event the service rendered by him under the autonomous body will not count as qualifying service for pension To have the service rendered by him under the autonomous body counted as qualifying service for pension in which case the pro-rata retirement or other terminal benefits received by him, will have to be deposited with the State Government concerned along with interest thereon from the date of receipt of those benefits by him till the date of deposit with the State Government. The right to count previous service as qualifying service for pension shall not revive until the whole amount has been paid 4. The

Chunk 509:
option shall be exercised within a period of one year from the date of issue of these orders. If no option is received within the prescribed time limit, the officer will be deemed to have opted for retention of the benefits received by him. The option once exercised or deemed to have exercised shall be final. 5. The

Chunk 510:
benefits of these orders will be admissible only if (i) (ii) The officer had applied or has applied to the UPSC for taking the competitive examination on the basis of which he was appointed to the IAS/IPS/IFS though proper channel or after obtaining permission from the autonomous body under whom he was working, and The officer was eligible for pro-rata retirement benefits/CPF benefits from the autonomous body at the time to leaving the service of the autonomous body and the autonomous body(or the officer, in a case coming under para 3 above) is prepared to pay to the State Government concerned such pro-rata retirement benefits/CPF benefits. 6.

In the aforesaid letter it was provided that members of AlS who had rendered pensionable war/military service before joining the AIS but have not so far opted for such service to be counted for Civil pension, could exercise fresh option within a period of 6 months from the date of issue of the Order. 2. It

Chunk 520:
has been represented to this Department by Association of Released ECO/SSC Officers and individuals that in some cases it has not been possible for Ministries/Departments and field officers to disseminate the information about the facility for exercise of option in terms of the above mentioned orders to the affected officers who were posted in the different parts of the country. As a result, many of these officers could not avail of the opportunity to exercise their option within the stipulated period. Keeping in view these representations, it has been decided as a one time relaxation, to provide a last opportunity to such ex-service pensioners who are at present re-employed in All India 396 Services to exercise the option for counting of their past military service as qualifying service within a period of six months from the date of issue of these orders. They may also be informed that no further extension of time will be allowed to exercise option. 3. The

No. 26011/1/77-Estt.B, dated the 18" May, 1977 regarding Grant of extension/re-employment of Central Government employees beyond _ the age of superannuation- Issue of consolidated instructions- The instructions on the grant of extension of service/re-employment to Central Government employees beyond the age of superannuation have been issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms) from time to time over a period of years starting from 1945 onwards. The existing instructions, being spread over a number of memoranda, have been summarised and given below in a consolidated form. The age of retirement of different categories of Central Government employees have been laid down in the Fundamental (Amendment) Rules, 1975 notified vide Notification No. 7(7)EV(A)/74, dated 7-2-75 of the Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure). On attaining the age indicated in the above rules, retirement is automatic and in the absence of specific orders to the contrary by the competent authority a Government servant must retire on the due date. The date superannuation of a Government servant is knowing advance and ordinarily there should not be the question of failure to make arrangements for his release sufficiently in advance. It is the responsibility of the administrative authority concerned to ensure that the Government servants under their control so retire. It would be appreciated that in each case of extension or re-employment, it is not only the next man who misses promotion but often several people miss consequential promotions all along the hierarchical _ strata.

advance. It is the responsibility of the administrative authority concerned to ensure that the Government servants under their control so retire. It would be appreciated that in each case of extension or re-employment, it is not only the next man who misses promotion but often several people miss consequential promotions all along the hierarchical _ strata. Thus, one person getting re-employment/extension means deferment of promotion for six or seven persons. Too many cases of extension in service or re-extension are to cause frustration and affect the moral of the staff in general. Keeping in view these circumstances _ the following criteria and that extensions/re-employment of superannuated officers are resorted to only in really exceptional circumstances. The procedure indicated in the following paragraphs should also be followed by the Ministries/Departments in regard to posts in statutory/autonomous bodies and Public sector Undertakings the initial appointments to which are required to be made by or with the approval of the President/Central Government. Ministries/Department of the Government of India should bring to the notice of the autonomous bodies the instructions mentioned herein and request them to consider whether similar principles should not be adopted by them for other appointments. 2.CRITERIA

Chunk 538:
FOR EXTENSION/RE- EMPLOYMENT (1) No proposal for extension of service/re-employment beyond the age of superannuation should ordinarily be considered. (2)Extension of service/re-employment can be justified only in very rare and exceptional circumstances. Even in such cases, 60 years of age should be the deadline for non-scientific/non-technical posts and 62 years in the case of scientific/technical personnel. This should not be construed to mean that extensions of service/re-employment can be granted to non-scientific/non- technical personnel upto the age of 60 years and to 399 scientific/technical personnel upto the age of 62 years more or less as a matter of course. The over-riding consideration for the grant of extension of service/re-employment is that it must be clearly in the public interest and in addition satisfy one of the following two conditions: (i) that other officers are not ripe enough to take over the job; or (ii) that the retiring officer is of outstanding merit. Test (i) would be satisfied only if there is shortage in a particular specialisation, or if it is not possible to find a suitable successor or if the officer is engaged on a work or project of vital importance which is likely to produce results in a year or two. If officers in the next lower post are not eligible for promotion on the ground that they have not put in the minimum service in the lower grade prescribed under the rules, no promotions can be made to the higher grade, unless such officer put in the requisite length of service. But officers who are eligible for promotion to the post against which extension/re-employment is recommended, should not be rejected solely on the ground that they do not have as much experience as the retiring officer. They should be considered for promotion a according to the recruitment rules

Chunk 539:
or two. If officers in the next lower post are not eligible for promotion on the ground that they have not put in the minimum service in the lower grade prescribed under the rules, no promotions can be made to the higher grade, unless such officer put in the requisite length of service. But officers who are eligible for promotion to the post against which extension/re-employment is recommended, should not be rejected solely on the ground that they do not have as much experience as the retiring officer. They should be considered for promotion a according to the recruitment rules and if they are found suitable they should be promoted to the posts being vacated by the retiring officer. Test (ii) would not be satisfied by the mere fact that the specialist (e.g. a scientific or technical officer) is fit in all respects or is otherwise able to discharge effectively of the post held by him. (3)No extension of service/re-employment should be considered on the ground that a suitable successor is not available unless it is established that action to select a successor had been taken well in advance, but the selection could not be finalised in time for justifiable reasons. (4) A proposal for the grant of extension of service/re-employment based merely on the consideration that the officer’s predecessor had been given extension/re-employment should obviously not be accepted. (5)Honorary appointment in Public Sector Undertakings in the case of honorary appointments, e.g. appointments on the Board of Directs of Public Sector Undertaking, the limit may be 65 years provided the appointment is really honorary and does not carry any substantial remuneration. (6)Appointments of retired officers even in honorary posts of Chairman and Members of the Board of Management including the Managing Director and the Financial Adviser (if the Financial Adviser is a member of the Board of Management) of any State/Government owned corporation, company or Enterprise or of various Public Sector Undertaking should not, as ageneral rule, be proposed for the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. However, where the Administrative Ministry/Department considers that there are exceptional circumstances

Chunk 540:
Sector Undertaking, the limit may be 65 years provided the appointment is really honorary and does not carry any substantial remuneration. (6)Appointments of retired officers even in honorary posts of Chairman and Members of the Board of Management including the Managing Director and the Financial Adviser (if the Financial Adviser is a member of the Board of Management) of any State/Government owned corporation, company or Enterprise or of various Public Sector Undertaking should not, as ageneral rule, be proposed for the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. However, where the Administrative Ministry/Department considers that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify the appointment of are tired officer, a detailed justification should be given for the consideration of the Appointments Committee. (3) Criteria for higher officers:- While making proposals for extension of service/re-employment in higher posts, it is all the more necessary to apply higher standards of efficiency to persons whose appointments to the higher posts are recommended for approval of Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. The number of top posts is bound to be very limited and a few persons should not have them for too long. VI. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WHO TOOK PART IN NATIONAL MOVEMENT: Persons who took part in the National Movement and were thereby prevented from the availing themselves the normal opportunities for entry into Government service has been granted age concessions in the matter of entering into government service (vide MHA’s 400 Office Memorandum No. 15/21/48-Estt., dated 29.11.

They have also been allowed, subject to certain conditions, to add to their service qualifying for superannuation persons, (but not for any other class of pension), the actual period not exceeding % of the length of their service of the actual period of 5 years whichever _ is least, However, as regards the question of grant of extension of service/re-employment beyond the age of superannuation, they will be governed by the same orders as are applicable to other Central Government employees. Vil. CURTAILMENT OF THE PERIOD OF EXTENSION/RE-EMPLOYMENT: A situation might arise where the grant of extension of service/re-employment beyond the age of superannuation for a specified period might have to be cancelled or modified at a later date for administrative reasons. As the Government is committed to retaining the officer for a specified period, it cannot dispense with his service before the expiry of that period except on disciplinary grounds. It is, therefore, necessary that in every case the order granting an extension of service/re-re-employment should include a clause providing for termination of service after three month’s/one month’s notice at any time within the period of extension/re-employment. Vill. PROMOTION: No government servant who is on extension of service after the prescribed date of retirement should be promoted to another post during the period of extension of service. IX. PAY: The pay of superannuated Government servants re-employed in Central Civil Department will be regulated in accordance with the instructions contained in Ministry of Finance Office Memorandum No.8(34)-E.III/57 dated 25-11-1958 (as amended from time to time). * * * * * * * Proforma for sending proposals for approval of Ministry of Home Affairs or for internal use_ in a Ministry/Department for grant of extension/re-employment to Government servants beyond the age of superannuation 1.

(ii) In cases where disciplinary proceedings are pending or contemplated against a member of the Service for the imposition of a major penalty andthe disciplinary authority having regard to the circumstances of the case, is of the view that the imposition of the major penalty of removal or dismissal for service would be warranted, the notice of voluntary retirement given by the officer concerned may not ordinarily be accepted. (iii) In cases where prosecution is contemplated or may have been launched in a court of law against a member of the service, the notice of voluntary retirement given by him may not ordinarily be accepted.

Chunk 561:
of procedure with a view to eliminating delays in the payment of pension and gratuity:- The undersigned is directed to refer to this Ministry's O.M. No. F.11(3)-EV(A)/76, dated the 28'" February, 1976, on the subject mentioned above, and to say that certain related issues have been separately under the consideration of the Government viz. (a) the manner in which pension cases which were pending on the date of effect of the afore said O.M. should be processed; (b) the application of the provisions of that O.M. to those cases of retirement on or after 29.2.

Chunk 562:
76 in which the ful two-year period envisaged in the time-table is not available; and (c) the manner in which pension papers should be processed in those cases in which retirement occurs ahead of the age of superannuation. Appropriate instructions in regard to these matters are laid down in the ensuing paragraphs. 2. Pending

pension cases - As the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 564:
76, was made applicable to persons retiring on or after 29.2.

Chunk 565:
76, such provisions of that O.M. as involve a liberalisation of entitlements would not be applicable to those who had _ retired prior to 29.2.

Chunk 566:
76. It

Chunk 567:
is, however, the Government's intention that the spirit and approach behind the procedural changes introduced in that O.M. should fully govern the processing of such pending pension cases. Even prior to the issue of that O.M., the C.C.S. (Pension) Rules, 1972, required advance action in regard to pension cases to be initiated one year ahead of the date of the retirement, vide Rules 62, 63 & 66; from July, ’75 onwards the advance action was to be initiated two years prior to the date of retirement, vide this Ministry’s notification 403 No. F.11(1)-EV(A)/73, dated the 14.7.

Chunk 568:
75. Moreover

Chunk 569:
, even prior to the issue of the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 570:
76, the procedures in force were designed to facilitate the commencement of the payment of pension on the first of the months in which it is due; the O.M. of 28.2.

Chunk 571:
76 merely sought to reinforce those intentions and objectives. In the light of the above, it has been decided that all pending pension cases of those who retired before 29.2.

Chunk 572:
76 should be processed and finalised (where this has been done already) strictly in accordance with the following instructions: (i) Where pension and death-cum-retirement gratuity have not yet been released even on provisional basis, action to draw and disburse provisional pension and provisional death- cum-retirement gratuity should be taken forthwith and the payments should commence not later than 1% June, 1976. For

Chunk 573:
this purpose, recourse may be had, if necessary, to the summary procedures laid down in paragraph 8(a) and (b) of the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 574:
76.

Chunk 575:
(ii) A flat period of six months at the maximum(four months for the Head of Office and two months for the office which is to issue (PPO/GPO) will be allowed for the final determination of pension and gratuity; the issue of the LPC, the ascertainment and adjustment of recoverable balance of loans and advances and other Government dues etc. Whatever the progress of work upto 29.2.

Chunk 576:
76, the pension cases should be positively completed during the period of six months from 1S March, 1976, fully in conformity with the spirit of the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 577:
76; and the final pension and gratuity payment orders should be issued not later than 31% August, 1976. If

Chunk 578:
the final PPO/GPO has not been issued by that date in any case, the provisions of paragraphs 8(c), 9 and 10 should be fully applicable.After 1S‘ September, 1976, there should be no pending pension cases relating to any Government servant who retired prior to 29.2.

Chunk 579:
76 (except those in which disciplinary proceedings are in progress). It shall be the responsibility of Heads of Departments to ensure that the dates laid down above are adhered to.  3. Cases

Chunk 580:
of retirement on or after 29.2.

Chunk 581:
76 in which the two-year time table is not feasible. (I) Some Government servants might have already retired on or after 29.2.

Chunk 582:
76 and others might be due to retire on varying dates in the future but with less than two years to go. However, as already mentioned, the rules and orders in force prior to the issue of the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 583:
76 did require advance action to be taken to initiate pension cases one year prior tothe date of retirement; and this was changed to two years by this Ministry’s notification No. 11(1)-EV(A)/73 dated 14.7.

Chunk 584:
75. There

Chunk 585:
should, therefore, be no difficulty in processing the pension and gratuity in accordance with the time-table laid down in paragraph 2(a) of the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 586:
76, at least in all those cases in which the Government servants are due to retire in July, 77 or later (i.e., two years after the issue of the notification of 14.7.

Chunk 587:
75 referred to above). (ii) In respect of Government servants who are due for retirement before July, 1977 it has to be presumed that in pursuance of the extent rules and orders, preparatory work on pension cases, must have started one year prior to the date of retirement. In cases where the preparatory work was not taken in hand, the work should be taken in hand immediately. To the extent that the two-year period envisaged in clause (a) of para 2 of the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 588:
76 is not fully available, the abridgement of the time table should take place essentially by a reduction of the time allotted to the first stage envisaged in the aforesaid clause, the other stages remaining unaltered; and the actual work of preparation of pension papers, viz. the reckoning of qualifying service and average emoluments should be taken in hand eight months before the date of retirement and the rest of the time-table applied accordingly. (iii) In respect of government servants who are due to retire in the very near future (say within the next ten months) and in whose cases the preparatory work on the processing of the pension cases has not been taken in hand, the provision of the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 589:
76 would be fully applicable subject only to the practical limitation that the four separate stages envisaged in sub-paragraphs (a), (b),(c) & (d) of paragraph 2 of the O.M. would get compressed into one stage. The grant of provisional pension and provisional gratuity 404 on the first of the month in which pension is due and the final settlement of the pension case and all related matters within a period of 6 months from the date of retirement in terms of paragraphs 8, 9 10 of the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 590:
76 would, of course, be mandatory.  4. Retirement

Chunk 591:
ahead of the age of superannuation - In case of retirement on a retiring pension clause (I) or (k) under F.R. 56 or under Rule 48 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, or retirement on invalid pension or compensation pension under Rule 38 and 39 respectively of the CCS(Pension) Rules, or retirement on absorption in or under a Corporation, Company on Body under Rule 37 of those rules, it is not possible to anticipate the date of retirement and consequently it is not feasible to initiate advance action in accordance with the two- year time table laid down in the O.M. dated 28.2.

Chunk 592:
76. Nevertheless

Chunk 593:
, this does not detract from the principle that the pension case has to be finalised as quickly as possible in such cases also. Action should be commenced immediately after the fact of the impending retirement of the government servant is known and the pension case and all other related matters and formalities should be fully completed not later than six months from the date of retirement. In such cases also, a provisional Rules, and no permission of the Government of India is required. 5. AIS

The following decision has been taken in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Pension and PW In the light of the earlier Government of India decisions taken in this regard. (i) _ It is clarified that pensionary benefits of officers belonging to the All India Services who retire from Government of India while on Central deputation with the Central Government may, at their option, be finalized and paid by the Ministries/Departments from which they retire as per the procedure in respect of similarly placed AIS officers belonging to the UT Cadre vide this Department's letter No.25011/4/83-AIS(Il) dated 11" July, 1984 (p.314, AIS Manual Vol.1, 2002). (ii) Other benefits like leave encashment, GPF etc. shall also be finalized by the Ministries/Departments from which they retire. (iii) The pensionary liability of All India Services Officers is of the State Government on whose Cadre they are borne. This pensionary liability would continue to be of the State Government concerned. Therefore debit would need to be raised against the respective State Government for pension paid by the Ministries/Departments of the Government of India in respect of such All India Service Officers. 2.

of Procedure for payment of pension and other benefits to All India Service officers retiring from Government of India/State Governments:- | am directed to refer to the earlier O.M.s of even number dated 3 June, 2004 and 11'" July, 2005 issued by this Ministry on the subject mentioned above. Earlier, the payment of pension to All India Service officers, including those officers who were on deputation with the Central Government, was being made by the respective State Governments on whose cadre those officers were borne. After considering the difficulties experienced by these officers and with a view to simplifying the procedure it was decided by the Government that the AIS officers who were on deputation with the Union Government at the time of retirement could opt for payment of pension and other retirement benefits through the Central Government. Accordingly, suitable instructions were issued by the Controller General of Accounts, Ministry of Finance, Department of Expenditure. 2. Measures

Chunk 603:
for further simplification of the procedure for payment of pension and other retirement benefits to AIS officers retiring from Government of India/State Governments has been under consideration of the Government of India. In consultation with the Ministry of Finance and Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare it has now been decided that the following revised procedures/systems would be followed. i) Government of India would take over the entire pension liability of all AIS officers, retired as well as retiring, both from the State and Central Government. ii) All retiring AIS officers would uniformly have the option of drawal of pension through Government of India or through the State Government. Authorisation of pension for members of the services retiring from State Government would continue with the State Governments. However, officers who retire from the State Government can now opt for payment of pension from the Central Government or the State Government. Similarly, officers retiring from Government of India may opt for authorisation of pension through Government of India or the State Government. 406 ii) iv) v) vi) vii) viii) ix) x) xi) Existing AIS pensioners shall also be given an option to draw their pension from the State/Central Government as in the case of future retirees. In respect of officials retiring from the State Governments and opting to receive pension through State Government, the existing system of authorisation/issue of Pension Payment Order (PPO), payment and accounting of pension and other retirement benefits through the administrative structure of the State Governments/Accountants General will continue as hithertofore. In these cases, the Government of India would reimburse the expenditure to the State, subject to compliance with the Central Government rules and instructions in this regard, in a manner similar to the reimbursement of House Building Advance scheme for All India Services.

In these cases, the Government of India would reimburse the expenditure to the State, subject to compliance with the Central Government rules and instructions in this regard, in a manner similar to the reimbursement of House Building Advance scheme for All India Services. Guidelines for claiming reimbursement from the Central Government would be issued separately by the Controller General of Accounts, Ministry of Finance, Government of India. Pension authorisation, etc. of officials retiring from the Government of India and opting to draw pension through the Government of India, shall be processed in accordance with the O.M.s dated 3/6/2004 and 11/7/2005 referred to in paragraph 1 above. In respect of officials retiring from the State Government and opting to draw pension through the Government of India, a Designated Authority in each State would completely process all matters relating to the determination of pension, gratuity, adjustment/recovery of advances/other dues and send the PPO for further processing by the Central Pension Accounting Office, Ministry of Finance, New Delhi (CPAO). The CPAO would, thereafter, process/forward these cases to the relevant bank branches (through whom the pensioner desires drawl of pension) in a manner similar to the other Central Civil Pensioners. The Designated Authority in each state, shall be communicated by the State Government to the CPAO. The banks would follow a procedure similar to those followed in respect of central civil pensioners, while disbursing pension to the All India Service officials. The ‘Scheme for Payment of Pension to Central Government Civil Pensioners by Authorised Banks’ shall be followed, mutatis-mutandis, in respect of AIS officials.

daughter of amoS, who was unmarried at the time of his death, does not forfeit her share of moS’ gratuity on account of her subsequent marriage: - A member of the service died while in service without making any nomination. One of the surviving members of his family, an unmarried daughter, got married subsequently before the death gratuity was paid. A question arose whether the daughter who was unmarried at the time of his death and was eligible for a share of the death gratuity, forfeited her share on account of her subsequent marriage. 2. According

to sub-rule (2) (i) the death gratuity became payable to the surviving members of the officer’s family mentioned in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of rule 21(i) (a) on the date of his death. An interest in the gratuity had thus accrued to and became vested in each member of the family of the deceased at the time of death. His daughter who was since married was, therefore, entitled to payment of an equal share of the death gratuity along with other members of his family and her right was not forfeited on account of her subsequent marriage.

(b) In cases where the disciplinary/judicial proceedings are dropped on account of the death of the Government servant during the pendency of disciplinary/judicial proceedings, the payment of gratuity will be deemed to have fallen due on the date following the date of death and if the payment of gratuity has been delayed, interest may be allowed for the period of delay beyond 3 months from the date of death. (Cc ~ In cases where the Government servant is not fully exonerated on the conclusion of disciplinary/judicial proceedings and where the competent authority decides to allow payment of gratuity in such cases the payment of gratuity will be deemed to have fallen due on the date of issue of orders by the competent authority for payment of gratuity vide DP &AR’s OM No. 7(1)/79P dated 11.7.

1979. If

Chunk 629:
the payment of gratuity is delayed in such cases interest will be payable for the period of delay beyond 3 months from the date of issue of the above mentioned orders by the competent authority. On retirement other than on superannuation:- Such cases of retirement will be either under clause (j) or clause (k) of FR 56 or Rules 38, 39, 40, 48 or 48-A of the CCS (Pension sanctioning authority does not get adequate time for processing pension papers, contrary to the case of retirement on superannuation. Instructions have already been issued from time to time that the work relating to verification of service should be done on year to year basis and should not be kept in arrears. Provisions also exist that and should not be kept in arrears. Provisions also exist that on completion of 25 years of service (qualifying) or on one being left with 5 years service before the date of retirement, whichever is earlier, the Head of Office should verify the service rendered by such government communicate to him the period of qualifying service as determined vide Rule 32 of the CSS(pension) Rule, 1972. It

Chunk 630:
is, therefore, expected that even in cases of retiring employees. It has therefore been decided that where the payment of gratuity in such cases is delayed beyond 6 months from the date of such retirement, interest should be paid for the period of delay beyond 6 months from the date of retirement. On death of the government servant while in service:- Such cases may be considered on the same line as mentioned in clause (ii) above. Detailed procedure for processing the payment of death gratuity is explained in Rule 77 to 80 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. It

Chunk 631:
is felt that in these cases also it should be possible for the respective offices to process the payment of death gratuity within a reasonable time. It has, therefore, been decided that where the payment of death gratuity is delayed beyond 6 months from the date of death, interest should be paid for the period of delay beyond 6 months from the date of death. If in any case the payment of death gratuity is held up on account of more than one claimant staking his/her qualify for payment of interest in terms of these orders. These will be examined separately in consultation with this Department on the merits of each. Cases where the amount of gratuity already paid is enhanced on account of revision of emoluments or libralisation in the provisions relating to gratuity from the date prior to the date of retirement of the government servant concerned:- At present, no interest is paid in such cases. Representations have been received that the payment of difference in gratuity in such cases is unduly delayed. It is expected that once the orders relating to revision of emoluments reckoning _ for 410 gratuity or liberalisation of rules relating to entitlement of gratuity is issued, the difference in gratuity should be paid within a reasonable time. Taking into account of arrears of a gratuity is delayed beyond a period of 3 months from the date of issue of the orders revising the emoluments/liberalisation in the rules, interest may be allowed for the delay beyond the period of 3 months of the date of issue on the said orders. (v) In cases of permanent absorption in PSU/autonomous bodies otherwise than on en-mass transfer on conversion of Government department or a part thereof into PSU/autonomous body:- Payment of interest on delayed payment of gratuity

Chunk 632:
gratuity is issued, the difference in gratuity should be paid within a reasonable time. Taking into account of arrears of a gratuity is delayed beyond a period of 3 months from the date of issue of the orders revising the emoluments/liberalisation in the rules, interest may be allowed for the delay beyond the period of 3 months of the date of issue on the said orders. (v) In cases of permanent absorption in PSU/autonomous bodies otherwise than on en-mass transfer on conversion of Government department or a part thereof into PSU/autonomous body:- Payment of interest on delayed payment of gratuity in these cases may also be decided in the same manner as prescribed in clause above. If the payment of gratuity has been delayed beyond 6 months from the date of permanent absorption the interest may be allowed for the period of delay beyond 6 months. 2. As

Chunk 633:
far as retirement on superannuation is concerned, the existing procedure for grant of interest if the payment of gratuity is delayed due to administrative reasons/lapses for no fault of the retiring employee will continue to be applicable. In other words, interest will be allowed for the period of delay beyond 3 months from the date of retirement. 3. It

Chunk 634:
has also been observed that there is a general impression among the administrative authorities that interest is to be paid only after disciplinary action being taken against the defaulting staff found reasonable for the delay in payment of gratuity is concluded. It is hereby clarified that this impression is not correct. In all cases in which it is established that the delay in payment of gratuity was attributable to administrative lapse and for no fault of the retiring employee concerned, the interest should be paid without waiting for the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings against the defaulting staff. The disciplinary cases should be proceeded with separately. This may kindly be borne in mind while regulating cases under paragraphs 2 and 3 above. Wherever interest becomes payable in terms of these orders, the same shall be allowed upto the end of the months preceding the months in which gratuity/arrears of gratuity is paid. 4. These

Chunk 635:
orders shall take effect from the date of issue of this O.M. The cases of those government servants who retired/died while in service before this date would also be covered if gratuity has not been paid as on the date of issue of this office Memorandum and there has been delay in its payment beyond three months/six months, as the case may be , of the date of their retirement/death but the interest would be payable in such cases only from the date of the issue of this OM or three months/six months, as the case may be, from the date of retirement/death, whichever date is later. Past cases of retirement otherwise than on superannuation and on death already settled before the issue of this OM, however, need not be reopened . [2501 1/10/91-AIS(Il) dated 21.3.

In the normal course unless a_ period of 7 years has elapsed since the date of disappearance of the employee, he cannot be deemed to be dead and _ the retirement benefits cannot be paid to the family.  2. This

Chunk 641:
principle is based on Section 108 of the Indian Evidence Act Which provides that when the question is whether the man is alive or dead and it is proved that he has not been heard of for 7 years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive, the burden of proving that he is alive is shifted to the person who affirms it. 411 3. Withholding

Chunk 642:
of the benefits due to the family has been causing a great deal of hardship and it has been decided that:- (i) when an employee disappears leaving his family, the family can be paid in the first instance the amount of salary due, leave encashment due and the amount of G.P.F. having regard to the nomination made by the employee, (ii) After the elapse of a period of one year, other benefits like DCRG/amily pension may also be granted to the family subject to the fulfillment of living conditions. 4. The

Chunk 643:
above benefits may be sanctioned by the administrative Ministry/Department after observing the following formalities:- 1) The family must lodge a report with the concerned Police Station and obtain a report that the employee has not been traced after all efforts had been made by the police. 2) An Indemnity Bond should betaken from the nominee/dependents of the employee that all payments will be adjusted against the payments due to the employee in case he appears on the scene and make any claim. 5. The

It

Chunk 648:
has been decided to follow the provision contained in the Government of India Decision No. (1) below Rule 68 of CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972, as reproduced below, regarding the admissibility of interest on the gratuity allowed after the conclusion of judicial/departmental proceedings as there is no such provision under the All India Services (Death-cum- Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958:- “Where disciplinary or judicial proceedings against a Government servant are pending on the date of his retirement, no gratuity is paid until the conclusion of the proceedings and the issue of the final orders thereon. The gratuity if allowed to be drawn by the competent authority on the conclusion of the proceedings will be deemed to have fallen due on the date of issue of orders by the competent authority. In order to mitigate the hardship to the Government servants who, on the conclusion of the proceedings are fully exonerated, it has been decided that the interest on delayed payment of retirement gratuity may also be allowed in their cases in accordance with aforesaid instructions. In other words, in such cases, the gratuity will be deemed to have fallen due on the date following the date of retirement for the purpose of payment of interest on delayed payment of gratuity. The benefit of these instructions will, however, not be available to such of the Government servants who die during the pendency of judicial/disciplinary proceedings against them and 412 against whom proceedings are consequently dropped.” 3. The

Chunk 649:
decision in this respect shall be applicable in those cases only which have not been decided so far and future cases. Past cases are not to be re-opened.  4. In

its 44" Report, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Home Affairs had observed that timely payment of pension and retirement dues is not being made to the retiring Government employees and the Committee had recommended certain steps to ensure timely payment of pension and retirement dues to the retiring employees of the Union Government. The Government has decided to implement the recommendations vide Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare O.M.No.38/64/98-P&PW/(F) dated the 5" October, 1999 and it has been further decided to extend the same to AIS officials with suitable changes as follows: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (9) All pensioners’ dues are to be settled by strictly following the procedures laid down in the All India Services(Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958. Wherever

Chunk 651:
delays are anticipated, provisional pension should be sanctioned immediately. Any delay in processing of pension resulting in pension not being authorised on the last working day of retirement of the Government servant should be reported by the Head of the Office to the next higher authority who would watch the settlement of delayed cases. In respect of payment of gratuity, Rule 19A of the All India Services(Death- cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 may be referred to. As per this Rule, if the payment of gratuity has been delayed because of administrative lapse by more than three months from the date when its payment became due, interest at the rate prescribed by the Central Government from time to time shall be paid on the amount of gratuity in respect of the period beyond three months. In case of any such eventuality, the Chief Secretary of the State Government concerned would initiate action to fix responsibility to recover the amount from the concerned dealing official, Supervisor or Head of Office in proportion to their salary by following the prescribed procedure for the purpose. Once it has been decided to pay gratuity, the amount should be paid immediately pending a decision regarding payment of interest. This would reduce the interest liability, if any, on delayed payment of gratuity. In the matter of delayed payment of leave encashment, it is noted that there is no provision for payment of interest or for fixing responsibility. Moreover, encashment of leave is a benefit granted under the Leave Rules and not a pensionary benefit. In the matter of CGEGIS, the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance in their U.O.No.709/EV/99 dated the 6" August, 1999 has clarified that payments under CGEGIS cannot be termed as terminal benefit. As payments under this Scheme are made in accordance with a Table

In the matter of CGEGIS, the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance in their U.O.No.709/EV/99 dated the 6" August, 1999 has clarified that payments under CGEGIS cannot be termed as terminal benefit. As payments under this Scheme are made in accordance with a Table of benefit which takes into account the interest upto the date of cessation of service, no interest is payable on account of delayed payment in the Scheme. They have also clarified that CGEGIS payment cannot be withheld and no Government dues can be recovered from the accumulation except the amount claimed by the financial institution as due from the employee on account of loans taken for House building purpose. 5. There

Chunk 653:
is no provision either under the All India Services(Commutation of Pension) Regulations, 1959 or CCS(Commutation of Pension) Rules, 1981 for payment of interest on commutation value of pension. There is no prescribed date for payment of commutation 413 value. A pensioner continues to draw full pension till the payment of commutation value. As such, payment of interest on commutation value does not arise. Further, it may be stated that as per Rule 3 of AlS(Commutation of Pension) Regulations, 1959, a pensioner is not eligible to apply for commutation if any departmental/udicial proceedings is pending against him at the time of his retirement. He becomes eligible only after the departmentaljudicial proceeding is over. 6. The

The

Chunk 787:
question of rationalization and further liberalization of the existing schemes and guidelines has been engaging the attention of Government for quite some time, particularly in the context of the increase in militancy and extremist activities in different parts of the country. The Fifth Central Pay Commission having been appointed in the meantime, the 431 commission had been requested to examine the existing benefits available in terms of various schemes and guidelines and to recommend a comprehensive policy that could be adopted in regard to ex gratia payments in cases of death in various circumstances in any part of the country, which could replace all isolated decisions that might have been taken in the past by the Government or by various individual ministries for different disturbed region in the country. 5. In

Chunk 800:
Main condition to be satisfied for the payment of the ex gratia lumpsum compensation in the specified circumstances is that the death of the employee concerned should have occurred in the actual performance of bonafide official duties. In other words, a causal connection should be established between the occurrence of death and government service. 2. Powers

Chunk 801:
having been delegated to the Administrative Ministries to sanction ex gratia Payments under these orders, it shall be their responsibility as well as that of the Financial Advisers to satisfy themselves that the death of the government servant to be compensated by the payment of the lumpsum ex gratia to the family in fact occurred in the actual performance of bonafide official duties and to establish its causal connection and nexus with government service. This could be done on the basis of medical and other documents relating to the case. 3. Even

Chunk 802:
if a Government servant had died in such circumstances that a medical report could not be secured , the nexus and causal connection with government service would need to be adequately established in determining the entitlement to the ex gratia lumpsum payment. In deciding this issue all evidence (both direct and circumstantial)shall be taken into account and the benefit of reasonable doubt given to the claimant. The benefit of reasonable doubt will be extended more liberally in field service cases, as provided in the guidelines for conceding attributability of disablement or death to Government service forming part of the Central Civil Services (Extra ordinary Pension) Rules. 4. In

Chunk 803:
cases of accidents to commercial aircraft resulting in the death of passengers, compensation is payable to the next of kin by the national or private airline concerned in terms of international conventions. The ex-gratia lump sum compensation in terms of these orders will therefore, not be admissible in addition in the event of death due to accidents while travelling on duty by commercial aircraft and shall be restricted only to those cases where death occurs in an accident while travelling on duty by service aircraft. The payment of ex gratia in these cases will be without prejudice to the bond required to be executed by the civilian government employees indemnifying the Government against any claims on account of death while travelling by service aircraft. 5. Railways

Chunk 804:
also pay compensation to the next of kin of passengers killed in train accidents. Therefore, the ex gratia compensation admissible in terms of clause (a) of para 5 of these orders shall be reduced by the compensation, if any, received by the next of kin of Central Government Civilian employees killed in train accidents while travelling on duty. 6. Ex

Chunk 805:
-Gratia compensation under clause (b) of para 5 will be admissible to police personnel killed while employed in aid of the civil administration in quelling agitations, protest demonstrations, riots, etc. regardless of whether such agitations, demonstrations, etc. are resorted to by members of the public, political parties, etc. or by other public servants, including police personnel. In addition, in the context of a perceptible increase in violence- related incidents over the years, Central Government Civilian employees on duty could become unwitting victims of bomb blasts in public places or vehicles, indiscriminate shooting 433 incidents in public, etc. often resorted to by terrorists, anti-social elements, etc. The compensation under clause (b) will also, therefore, be admissible in cases of death in such incidents, provided the employees concerned were actually on duty at the relevant time. 7. Cases

Chunk 806:
of death resulting from acts of violence or assault by terrorists, anti-social elements, etc. against a Government servant with the intention of deterring or preventing him form performing his duties: or because of any act done or attempted to be done by such Government servant in the lawful discharge of his duties: or because of his official position will also be covered under clause (b). 8. Ex

Chunk 807:
-Gratia compensation under clause (c) of para 5 will generally be restricted only to those cases where the death of the employees is directly caused by actual field operations. In addition, families of Central Government Civilian Employees killed after being kidnapped by militants, terrorists, extremists, etc. because of their official position or with a view to spreading terror will also be entitled to the compensation under this clause. 9. Few

Chunk 808:
illustrative examples of cases to be covered under the different clauses of para 5 are contained in the Appendix for the guidance of sanctioning authorities. In case of any doubt in regard to the applicability of the ex gratia compensation scheme, such cases will be referred to the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare for appropriate decision in consultation with the Department of Expenditure. 10. The

Chunk 809:
ex-gratia compensation in the circumstances specified in these orders shall be admissible in addition to such other benefits as may be admissible under the Central Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules or the Liberalized pensionery Awards Scheme, as the case may be. This will also be mutually exclusive of such other benefits as may be admissible under the Central Government Employees' Group Insurance Scheme, General/Contributory Provident Fund. etc. and will be payable in addition to such benefits. 11. In

Chunk 810:
determining the admissibility of the ex gratia compensation payable from Central Government funds, ex gratia payments, if any, made to families of the deceased Government servants from State funds by the State Government concerned shall not be taken into account and shall be excluded.  12. In

Chunk 811:
certain cases, relief is also provided to families of deceased Government servants from sundry government sources, such as the Prime Minister's Relief Fund, Chief Minister's Relief Fund etc. In such cases, it should be ensured that the aggregate of the relief/ex gratia compensation paid from different sources does not exceed Rs 10 Lakhs in each individual case. 13. In

Chunk 812:
view of the fact that the ex gratia compensation in terms of these orders is payable to the families of the deceased Government servants, default or contributory negligence, if any, on the part of the Government servants concerned shall not be taken into account in sanctioning the compensation. 14.

Chunk 851:
to the States for re-employment of AIS officers in a private undertaking as a nominee Director by the Government or a public financial institution: - The question whether appointment of an All India Service pensioner in a private undertaking as a nominee Director by the Government or a public financial institution, amounts of acceptance of commercial employment under rule 26(1) of All India Service (DCRB) Rules, has been under the consideration of this Department. It has been decided to lay down the following instructions for the information and guidance of State Governments:- (1) Where the management of a private company is taken over by a public financial institution/State Government/ Central Government, ‘the appointment of a retired member of an All India Service as Chairman/Director/Managing Director by the public financial institution of the Government should be construed as “employment under a corporation controlled by Government”, as envisaged in explanation 1 below rule 26(1) ibid. Such an employment will not amount to commercial employment and the officer concerned will not require to obtain prior permission of the Central Government. (2) Where a public financial institution/Government appoints a retired member of an All India Service as Chairman/Director/Managing Director in a company, whose management continues in private hands, such employment will technically fall in the purview of expression “commercial employment’. It is, however, not necessary to treat such employment on par with normal commercial employment as it is the Government or the public financial institution as the case may be, that seeks to protest its interest through appointment of the retired member of the service as a nominee Director. The retired officer would be an appointee of the institution or the Government though he would receive his pay or free from the private company. In such cases, approval of the Central Government for permitting

It is, however, not necessary to treat such employment on par with normal commercial employment as it is the Government or the public financial institution as the case may be, that seeks to protest its interest through appointment of the retired member of the service as a nominee Director. The retired officer would be an appointee of the institution or the Government though he would receive his pay or free from the private company. In such cases, approval of the Central Government for permitting the officer to accept the appointment in question under rule 26(1) of All India Service (DCRB) Rules, 1958, could be presumed [DP& AR letter No. 26014/17/77-AlS(Il), dated 4.1.

(1) While forwarding applications from individual offices for permission to accept commercial employment during leave preparatory to retirement or after retirement, the State Government/Ministry may clearly specify whether they are satisfied that each of the following criteria is fulfilled, viz. (i) Has the officer while in service had any such dealing with the proposed employer as might create the suspicion that he had shown favour to the latter? (ii) Will his commercial duties be such that his official knowledge and experience could be used to give the employer an unfair advantage? (iii) Will his duties be such has might bring him into conflict with Government? (iv) Ils the proposed employment of a thoroughly reputable kind? (v) Are there any exceptional circumstances which would make the refusal of consent a real hardship? They may also indicate the salary which the officer excepts to receive on accepting commercial employment, [G.I., Ministry of Home Affairs letter No. 11/20/59-AlS(II), dated the 7'" August, 1959.

Accordingly, the form of application for permission to accept commercial employment prescribed under the Ministry of Home Affairs Letter No. 11/1/68-AIS(II), dated the 23% January, 1968 has been slightly amended and the revised form is annexed herewith.

] GOVERNMENT OF INDIA DECISION UNDER RULE 28 ANNEXURE A Copy of Ministry of Finance OM No.11(3)-EV(A), dated the 28" February, 1976 regarding simplification of procedures with a view to eliminating delays in the payment of superannuation pension and death-cum-retirement gratuity. The question of simplifying and expediting the procedures for the sanctioning and grant of pension to Central Government employees has been under Government’s consideration. The President is pleased to decide that the following modification in the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972, and other relevant orders will come into effect from 1St March, 1976, that is, in respect of persons retiring on or after 29"" February, 1976.

Chunk 856:
(a) Time table for the work The payment of superannuation pension should in all cases commence on the first of the month in which they are due. For this purpose, Head of Offices and others responsible for or connected with pension cases, including those responsible for issuing pension payment orders, will be required to observe the following time-schedule for the various processes leading to the authorisation and payment of pension and gratuity. The Government’s intention is that while the preliminary and preparatory work should be commenced sufficiently in advance and adequate time allowed for the various stage and processes of work, these should not be allowed to be unduly prolonged or to become interminable; to obviate this, firm cut off dates are prescribed for each stage such that when a cut-off date is reached the work will then necessarily proceed to the next stage. (i) The Head of Office or other authority responsible for preparing the pension papers will initiate the pension case two years before the date of retirement of the Government servant. At this stage, the work will be essentially that of assembling the information necessary for working out the qualifying service(or, at a later date, the calculation of average emoluments). As most delays in pension cases arise from gaps, deficiencies and imperfections in the service book records every effort should be made at this stage to remove these while at the same time keeping in mind that what is intended is not a total overhaul or audit of the entire service book or records, but only a scrutiny limited to the immediate purpose on hand, namely the preparation of the pension papers. This process should be completed in good time and at any rate not later than 8 months in advance of the date of retirement of

Chunk 857:
of average emoluments). As most delays in pension cases arise from gaps, deficiencies and imperfections in the service book records every effort should be made at this stage to remove these while at the same time keeping in mind that what is intended is not a total overhaul or audit of the entire service book or records, but only a scrutiny limited to the immediate purpose on hand, namely the preparation of the pension papers. This process should be completed in good time and at any rate not later than 8 months in advance of the date of retirement of the Government servant. (ii) On reaching that stage i.e., 8 months before the retirement date, the actual work of preparation of pension papers viz. the reckoning the qualifying service and the calculation of average emoluments, should be taken up. Any deficiency or imperfection or omission which still remains in the service records will be ignored at this stage and the determination of the qualifying service will be proceeded on the basis of entries in the service records, whatever the degree of perfection to which it might have been possible to bring them by that time. 439 (iii) The average emoluments will be determined with reference to emolument drawn during the last 10 complete months and not 36 months as was the practice here-to-from (while the period to be taken for average calculations has been reduced the other provisions of Rule 34 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972, will continue to apply utates mutandis). This work involves not merely an arithmetical calculation of the average emoluments but also a check of the correctness of the emoluments on the first date of the ten-month period would naturally depend on the correctness of the emoluments prior to this date. However, any such check of the correctness of past emoluments, whether in the office preparing the pension papers or later in the office, responsible for issuing the pension payment order, should not become an occasion for an extensive examination going back into the distant past; the check should be the minimum which is absolutely necessary,

Chunk 858:
utates mutandis). This work involves not merely an arithmetical calculation of the average emoluments but also a check of the correctness of the emoluments on the first date of the ten-month period would naturally depend on the correctness of the emoluments prior to this date. However, any such check of the correctness of past emoluments, whether in the office preparing the pension papers or later in the office, responsible for issuing the pension payment order, should not become an occasion for an extensive examination going back into the distant past; the check should be the minimum which is absolutely necessary, and it should in any case not go back to a period earlier than a maximum of 34 months preceding the date of retirement. (iv) The process of determining the qualifying service and the average emoluments and the admissible pension and gratuity should be positively completed within a period of 2 months, and the pension paper should be sent to the one responsible for issuing the pension payment order not later than 6 months before the date of retirement. That office will, after the necessary scrutiny of the papers (limited to the immediate purpose on hand as mentioned in sub- paragraph (a) and (c) above issue the pension payment order including the order for the payment of the death-cum-retirement gratuity) not later than 1 month in advance of date of retirement. (v) The time-schedule and procedures, mentioned above will equally apply utates mutandis to those cases in which the office which is to issue the Pension Payment Order has also the responsibility for the preparation of pension papers. (vi) In those cases in which the retirement of a Government servant takes place earlier than the normal date of compulsory retirement either in pursuance of the provisions of FR 56(i) or (k) (and the corresponding provision in the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972, or because of the deemed retirement in terms of Rule 37 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 on the grounds of permanent absorption in a public sector undertaking, autonomous bodies, the nature of the retirement would preclude advance action in regard

In such case too, the pension case would have to be processed very expeditiously and instructions in this regard will be issued separately. 2. Extraordinary

Chunk 860:
Leave and Suspension (a) Under Rule 21 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972, extraordinary leave granted on medical certificate qualifies for pension. The appointing authority may, at the time of granting extraordinary leave. Also allow the period of such leave to count as qualifying for pension if the leave is granted to a Government servant; (i) due to his inability to join or rejoin the duty on account of civil commotion, or (ii) for prosecution higher technical and scientific studies, extraordinary leave taken on other grounds is treated as non-qualifying, and , therefore, a definite entry in the service book being qualifying or otherwise is required to be made simultaneously with the event. Even where this is not done, it should still be possible to rectify the omission during the period allowed for preparatory action i.e. from two years in advance of the retirement date upto eight months before retirement. At the end of that period however(i.e. when the actual preparation of the pension papers is taken in hand as laid down in paragraph 2(b) above) no further inquiry into past events or check or past records 440 should be undertaken. Specific entries in the service records regarding non- qualifying periods will be taken note of and such periods excluded from the service. All spells of extraordinary leave not covered by such specific entries will be deemed to be qualifying service. (b) Similarly, Rule 23 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 requires that in cases other than those in which suspension has been held to be wholly unjustified the competent authority should at the appropriate time declare whether and to what extent the period of suspension will count towards the qualifying service. Specific entries in this regard in the service book/records will be taken note of at the time of reckoning qualifying

will be taken note of and such periods excluded from the service. All spells of extraordinary leave not covered by such specific entries will be deemed to be qualifying service. (b) Similarly, Rule 23 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 requires that in cases other than those in which suspension has been held to be wholly unjustified the competent authority should at the appropriate time declare whether and to what extent the period of suspension will count towards the qualifying service. Specific entries in this regard in the service book/records will be taken note of at the time of reckoning qualifying service. In the absence of the specific entry, period of suspension shall be taken as counting towards the qualifying service. 3. Break

Chunk 862:
in Service In the absence of a specific indication to the contrary in the service records, an interruption between two spells of service rendered under the Central Government including service aid out of Defence Services Estimates or Railways Estimates will be treated as automatically condoned and the pre-interruption service treated as qualifying service for pension, except where it is otherwise known that the interruption was caused by resignation, dismissal or removal from service or participation in a strike. The period of interruption itself will under no circumstances reckoned as qualifying service for pension. 4. Deputation

Chunk 863:
/Foreign Service (a) There are some cases in which, in accordance with the terms of deputation/foreign service, it is the responsibility and liability of the Government servant himself to maintain pension contributions. In such cases, it will be necessary to ascertain whether the recoveries have been made before the period of foreign service is reckoned as qualifying service. However, the Government servant is sometimes put to considerable difficulty because of defective or incomplete record maintenance by _ the administrative/accounts offices. In such case while he could be reasonably asked to show that he had indeed made the contributions, the administrative authority should show a spirit of reasonableness and a accommodation in evaluating and accepting such evidence as he is able to put forward, and not insist rigidly on formal proof. (b) Where, however, the responsibility for making pension contributions is that of the borrowing organisation and where either some of the contributions have not been recovered or the records in respect of the recoveries of such contributions are incomplete, while the authorities concerned should pursue the matter with the borrowing organisation separately for appropriate action this should have no bearing on the processing and finalisation of pension papers. 5. Administrative

Chunk 864:
sanction to pension and the concept of approved service (a) It has been noticed that the submission of pension papers to the Head of the Department or Appointing Authority for administrative sanction to pension with reference to a concept of approved service though this is largely a formality in the vast majority of cases, nevertheless leads to a good deal of delay in the finalisation of pension cases, it has, therefore, been decided that the requirement of an administrative sanction to pension which is referred to in a number of places in the CCS(Pension) Rules, should be dispensed with the determination of pension will thereafter be merely a matter of calculation in accordance with the rules and the pension papers need not be submitted to the Head of the Department or the Appointing Authority. (b) However, the intention behind the provisions in Rule 6 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, under which less than the full admissible quantum of pension/gratuity can be granted after a summary procedure in a particular case on the grounds of unsatisfactory service or conduct, 441 is not proposed to be given up. Recourse to this provision will, obviously be had only in exceptional cases and for this purpose it is not considered necessary to submit all pension cases to the Head of the Department or the Appointing Authority or subject them to a process of administrative sanction. Instead, at the time when the preparation of pension papers is taken up, i.e. 8 months prior to the retirement date, the Head of the Office should address a separate inquiry to the Appointing Authority whether there is any intention to grant less than full pension or to institute any proceedings. (The pension papers need not be sent to that authority for this purpose). In the absence of a reply

purpose it is not considered necessary to submit all pension cases to the Head of the Department or the Appointing Authority or subject them to a process of administrative sanction. Instead, at the time when the preparation of pension papers is taken up, i.e. 8 months prior to the retirement date, the Head of the Office should address a separate inquiry to the Appointing Authority whether there is any intention to grant less than full pension or to institute any proceedings. (The pension papers need not be sent to that authority for this purpose). In the absence of a reply to this inquiry, the authority preparing the pension papers should assume that there is no intention to grant less than full pension/gratuity and should process the pension paper accordingly so as to transmit them by the prescribed deadline to the authority responsible for issuing the pension payment order. If, on the other hand, the appointing authority does decide that there is a case for granting less than the full admissible pension/gratuity the procedure laid down in Rule 6 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 should be followed, and this process should be positively completed before the deadline for sending the pension papers to the authority responsible for issuing the pension payment order is reached i.e., earlier than 6 months prior to the retirement date. (c) Where the responsibility for preparing the pension papers rests with an authority other than the Head of the Office concerned, it shall be the responsibility of the Head of the Office(or that of the next higher authority, where the pension case is that of the Head of the Office himself) to ascertain in advance from the appointing authority and communicate to the authority responsible for preparing the pension papers any intention to grant less than the full admissible pension/gratuity, not later than 6 months prior to the retirement date. Where no such intimation has been received the authority responsible for preparing pension papers will process the pension case on the assumption that full admissible pension and gratuity may be granted. 6.

Where no such intimation has been received the authority responsible for preparing pension papers will process the pension case on the assumption that full admissible pension and gratuity may be granted. 6. Right

Chunk 867:
to withhold or withdraw pension (a) Nothing contained in para 6 above is intended to affect the provisions of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 which provide for the withholding or withdrawing of pension. (b) Where departmental or judicial proceedings instituted during the service of the Government servant are not likely to be finalised by the date of retirement, action to grant provisional pension in terms of Rule 65 or Rule 74 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972, should be taken so that the retiring Government servant not be put to undue hardship. The provisions of paragraph 8(c) below will not apply to provisional pension granted in terms of Rules 65 or Rule 74 of the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972.

Chunk 868:
(c) If, after the pension papers have been forwarded to the office responsible for issuing the Pension Payment Order in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2(d) above, any event occurs which has a bearing on the amount of pension admissible, the fact shall be promptly reported to the office responsible for issuing the Pension and Gratuity Payment Orders. 7. Payment

Chunk 869:
of Provisional Pension and Gratuity (a) The time table laid down in paragraph 2 above is intended to be followed strictly. If however, for any special reasons it has not been found possible to complete and forward the pension papers to the office responsible for issuing the Pension payment Orders within the prescribed time schedule in a particular case, of if the pension papers have been sent late to that office and/or that office has either returned the papers to the Head of Office for eliciting further information or has not been able to issue the Pension Payment Order before one month prior to the date of retirement of the Government servant, steps shall be taken by the Head of Office to authorise the payment of provisional pension and gratuity by the first of the month in which it is due. For this purpose, such information as is available in the official records may be used, and further, the Head of Office should ask the retiring Government servant, for a simple statement giving his total length of service(from the date of joining duty 442 to the date of retirement indicating the period of breaks, if any) and also the emoluments during the last ten months of service. The retiring Government servant may also be asked to certify that the facts stated by him are correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. If complete information in regard to the emoluments drawn during the last ten months is not available either with the Head of Office or with the Government servant, the emoluments last drawn should be taken provisionally as average emoluments. The Head of Office shall sanction 100% of the pension calculated with reference to the information so obtained as a provisional pension. The death-cum-retirement-gratuity should similarly be determined.

Chunk 870:
during the last ten months of service. The retiring Government servant may also be asked to certify that the facts stated by him are correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. If complete information in regard to the emoluments drawn during the last ten months is not available either with the Head of Office or with the Government servant, the emoluments last drawn should be taken provisionally as average emoluments. The Head of Office shall sanction 100% of the pension calculated with reference to the information so obtained as a provisional pension. The death-cum-retirement-gratuity should similarly be determined. The provisional pension and gratuity will be drawn and disbursed by the Head of Office in respect of non-gazetted Government servants. Before disbursing the provisional gratuity, all known dues such as long term advances still outstanding, over-payment of pay and allowances etc. and other recoveries due, shall be adjusted. Where no such adjustments are due, a deduction of 10% of the gratuity of Rs.1,000/- whichever is less, shall be made partly for adjustment in the light of the final determination of the gratuity. (b) At present, in respect of gazetted Government servants it is the Accounts Office which issues an Anticipatory Pension Payment Order where the final pension has not been determined. In modification of this it has been decided that in these cases too, if the final pension payment order has not been issued by the Accounts Officer one month before the retirement date, the Government servants may ask the Head of Office for the drawal and disbursement of a provisional pension and gratuity. For this purpose, the procedure laid down in clause(a) will equally apply. (c) Provisional Pension to become final after six months - The provisional pension is not intended to be continued on provisional basis beyond a period of six months from the date of retirement. If the office responsible for issuing the Pension Payment Order has not finalised the pension case by that time, the provisional pension shall be deemed to have become final and it will be obligatory for the office concerned to issue

Chunk 871:
the Head of Office for the drawal and disbursement of a provisional pension and gratuity. For this purpose, the procedure laid down in clause(a) will equally apply. (c) Provisional Pension to become final after six months - The provisional pension is not intended to be continued on provisional basis beyond a period of six months from the date of retirement. If the office responsible for issuing the Pension Payment Order has not finalised the pension case by that time, the provisional pension shall be deemed to have become final and it will be obligatory for the office concerned to issue the final Pension Payment Order for the amount of pension and gratuity already calculated on a provisional basis: and the deduction made from the gratuity as per sub-paragraph (a) above shall also be released subject to the provisions of paragraphs 9 and 10 below. 8. Last

Chunk 872:
Pay Certificate The issue of a Last Pay Certificate should not be insisted upon before the payment of provisional pension. During the period of six months after retirement which has been provided for various purposes above, it should be possible for the Head of Office or other office concerned to issue the Last Pay Certificate to a Government servant. In cases in which the Last Pay Certificate has not been issued by the time the formal Pension/Gratuity Payment Orders are received(whether this happens prior to the retirement of the Government servant as per paragraph 2(d) above, or after his retirement and after the grant of a provisional pension), the Gratuity Payment Order will in any case include a provision for the withholding 10% of the gratuity of Rs.1,000/- whichever is less, pending the production of the Last Pay Certificate. 9 Adjustment of Government dues (a) Dues pertaining to Government accommodation - The existing procedures for the issue of No Demand Certificates by the Directorate of Estates and the adjusted dues pertaining to the continued occupation of Government accommodation after retirement will for the present continue. (b) Dues other than those pertaining to Government accommodation — In respect of other Government dues steps should be taken to ascertain or assess the outstanding dues when the processing of pension papers is taken up two years prior to the retirement date. As the next stage of the actual preparation of pension papers is reached only after a year and four months, there is ample time for ascertaining all kinds of Government dues. Once this stage is reached, i.e. eight months before the retirement of the Government servant, any further probing of records for recoveries due shall cover only a limited period i.e., not 443 more than two years before the date of retirement.

dues steps should be taken to ascertain or assess the outstanding dues when the processing of pension papers is taken up two years prior to the retirement date. As the next stage of the actual preparation of pension papers is reached only after a year and four months, there is ample time for ascertaining all kinds of Government dues. Once this stage is reached, i.e. eight months before the retirement of the Government servant, any further probing of records for recoveries due shall cover only a limited period i.e., not 443 more than two years before the date of retirement. It should thus be quite possible for the Head of Office, or the office which is to issue the Pension Payment Order, as the case may be, to ascertain or assess all the dues, particularly those pertaining to long-term advances such as house building or conveyance advances, over payments of pay and allowances, and such other dues, prior to the prescribed deadline for the issue of the Pension Payment/Gratuity Payment Orders or the Provisional pension/gratuity order. The pension papers should clearly indicate the total amount of outstanding dues which should be recovered out of the death-cum-retirement-gratuity before authority for the payment of gratuity(whether final or provisional) is issued, and if, after the pension papers have been transmitted to the office responsible for issuing the Pension Payment Order, additional recoveries to be made from the gratuity come to notice, the fact shall be promptly reported to that office. In a case where no major recoveries are due, 10% of the gratuity of Rs.1,000/- has been withheld because there might be unassessed Government dues, or because the gratuity has been provisionally paid as per paragraph 9(a) above, or because Last Pay Certificate has not been received(see paragraph 9 above), the withheld amount shall automatically become payable on the expiry of the six months after retirement. The Head of Office(or the office issuing the pension and gratuity payment orders) shall indicate in the orders granting a provisional gratuity( or the final Gratuity Payment Order) itself the amount shall be released by the office

The Head of Office(or the office issuing the pension and gratuity payment orders) shall indicate in the orders granting a provisional gratuity( or the final Gratuity Payment Order) itself the amount shall be released by the office disbursing the pension without further instructions on the expiry of the period of six months from the date of retirement, unless instructions for the recovery of a specified sums from the withheld amount are issued within the aforesaid period. 10. Accountability

Chunk 875:
of officers charged with the maintenance of records - In taking the above decisions, Government have preceding on the basis that in spite of every effort imperfections may remain in the records and procedures but that it would be unfair to a retiring Government servant if he had to suffer because of the lapses of those responsible for the proper maintenance of service records. The fact that under the new procedures the presumption will be in favour of the Government servant if the records are incomplete or deficient in any manner underlines the importance of ensuring the proper, regular and timely completion of all the service and accounts records by the offices concerned, so as to minimise the occasion for making such presumptions. It has accordingly been decided that if, in future service records are found to be incomplete or imperfect at the time of processing and finalising pension case, those cases will not be delayed but the officials responsible for the maintenance of the records will be held accountable for any deficiencies, failure or omissions therein, and action will be initiated against them. The Heads of Department will ensure that these directions are complied with. In supersession of Department of Personnel & AR letters No.2501 1/9/79-AlS(II), dated the 5'" September, 1979 and 11 November, 1980, it has been decided to lay down the following procedure for preparation of pension papers and issue of pension payment orders in the case of IAS and IPS officers borne on the Union Territories Cadre:- (i) Officers retiring from service while working under Union Territory Administrations — The Union Territory Administration concerned will prepare pension papers and the Accounts Officer accredited to the UT Administration will issue the pension payment order.

It has been decided that the arrears will be paid in two installments of 40% & 60% in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 respectively for All India Service officers. Arrears paid up to 31.3.

Chunk 1434:
2009 and 11.8.

Chunk 1435:
2009 it was provided that in case the information regarding date of birth/age is not available in the PPO or the office records, certain documents would be accepted as proof of date of birth/age for payment of additional pension/family pension on completion of age of 80 years and above. It was also provided that the Pension Disbursing Authority/Bank will make payment of additional pension/family pension in the above manner, on provisional basis, up to a period of three months from the month in which the proof of age/date of birth is 499 submitted by the pensioner/family pensioner. In such cases, the Pension Disbursing Authority/Bank will immediately send one copy each of the document submitted by the pensioner/family pensioner to the Pay and Account Officer/CPAO for formal authorisation of the additional pension/family pension. The Pension Disbursing Authority/Bank will make payment of additional pension/family pension beyond a period of three months only on receipt of such an authorisation from the Pay and Account Officer. 2. Certain

Chunk 1436:
Pension Disbursing Banks to whom the documentary proof of age was submitted by the pensioners/family pensioners have informed that many Pay & Accounts Offices, to whom the same is forwarded as per OM of even number dated 21/5/2009, have not communicated to them their final authorization in accordance with the above instructions. These Banks are, therefore, finding it difficult to continue the payment of additional pension beyond three months in the absence of the formal authorization. The PAOs who are receiving the proof of age may get it sanctioned from HOO/HOD as per procedure invariably. In case the pensioner/family pensioner is unable to submit any of the documents mentioned in OMs dated 21/5/2009 and 11/8/2009 but claims additional pension based on some other documentary evidence, such cases will be submitted to the administrative Ministry. If the administrative Ministry is satisfied about the claim of the pensioner/family pensioner, it will authorize additional pension/family pension accordingly. The decision of the Administrative Ministry in this regard will be final. 3. CGA

Chunk 1437:
is requested to advise all Pay & Accounts Officers to take immediate action for getting the additional pension sanctioned from Head of Office/HODs so that the final authorisation of the additional pension may be done by PAOs.  7. Instructions

This issue has been consulted with the Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO). In order to streamline the issue, the State Governments are required to adhere to the following procedures/provisions:- 500 (a) It is seen that different State Governments are making arrear payments of All India Service officers related to Sixth Pay Commission in different proportions.

Chunk 1442:
such, while sending the PPOs to CPAO, State Governments must clearly state “all arrears due to the pensioner up to 31% March, 2008 have been accounted and paid for by the State Government’. (b) Option forms of drawing Central Pension through the CPAO may be circulated to their AIS officers. (c) The Authorisation/PPOs in respect of AIS officers has to be uniform (i.e. at Central rate) in terms of admissibility of Dearness Relief, Medical Allowance etc. (d) All State Governments may appoint nodal officers for coordinating with CPAO in respect of AIS officers. (e) Basic information such as the cadre/year of joining etc. of the AIS officers must be mentioned in PPO’s to be sent to CPAO. All State Governments must ensure that claims of reimbursement in respect of AIS pension are received by CPAO from the concerned State AGs.
