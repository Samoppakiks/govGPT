2021 PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY Rajasthan State Co-operative Press Limited, JAIPUR GENERAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTS RULES FINANCIAL RULES & PROCEDURES PART - I PREFACE The General Financial & Accounts Rules contain basic Principles to be observed and the procedure to be followed by various authorities in dealing with the funds received by them in their public capacity. These Rules were published in 1952 and, there after, six more editions were published with the last being in 1986. However

, during all these years no major structural changes to meet the present day requirements had been attempted. In the last few years, there has been rapid expansion in the activities of the state, especially in the field of social security, upliftment of weaker sections of the society and development of infrastructural facilities to accelerate the pace of rapid economic growth. Consequently, a number of changes have taken place in the mode and norms of the functioning of various Government Departments. It was, therefore, felt that unless these financial rules, systems and procedures are also brought in consonance with the present day requirements, the same instead of regulating the activities within broad parameters of financial discipline and control, may in fact tend to prove impediments in the efficient and speedy execution of various schemes. The Finance Department had, therefore, decided to have a fresh look at these Rules. Against this back-drop and context, it was considered expedient to rewrite these Rules. Shri Bhagwan Singh, a retired Chief Accounts Officer was entrusted with this job who submitted these Rules in three parts, namely :- Part-I fundamental Rules & Procedures. Part-II governing Store Purchases. Part-II delegation of financial powers to various officers subordinate to Govt. It is hoped that these re-written Rules will help the various authorities in dealing smoothly with the funds received by them in their official capacity and in case any major structural change is left due to which there appear difficulties in meeting the present day requirements, this may kindly be brought to the notice of the Finance (GF&AR) Department for appropriate action. Inspite of due care having been taken, if any, errors or omissions have inadvertently remained and are detected in this edition the same may also kindly be brought to the notice of the Finance (GF&AR)

Account The surplus funds if any, in the P.D.Account may at the request of the Institution may be kept by the Government in "Interest Bearing Deposits". Il] — PROCEDURE FOR RECOVERY OF LOAN AND INTEREST THEREON LOANS DRAWN IN INSTALLMENTS — RECOVERY AND INTEREST (1) When a loan of public money is taken out in installments, the first half-yearly repayment shall not be demanded until six months after the last installment is taken; meanwhile simple interest only shall be realised. But if it appears that there is an undue delay on the part of the debtor in taking out the last installment of a loan, the authority sanctioning the loan may, at the time declare the loan closed, and other repayment of capital to begin. The Accountant General will bring to notice any delay on this account and he will take this step whether there are any date fixed for taking of installments or not. It in any case particular dates have been fixed for the payment of interest or the repayment of installments ofaloan, when such repayment shall not begin until the second of the half- yearly (3) (4) Rule 301: Rule 302: 156 dates so fixed after the loan has been completely taken up, simple interest only being recovered on the first half-yearly date after the completion of the loan. For example, supposing a loan, the interest of which is recoverable half-yearly to be completely taken up on 31‘ March and the interest to be payable on 30" June and 31“ December, the first half-yearly installment in repayment of principal will not be due until 31 December following simple interest only will be due on the intermediate 30" June; Note : These instructions are applicable mutatis mutandis to loans, the repayment of which are made by other than

loan has been completely taken up, simple interest only being recovered on the first half-yearly date after the completion of the loan. For example, supposing a loan, the interest of which is recoverable half-yearly to be completely taken up on 31‘ March and the interest to be payable on 30" June and 31“ December, the first half-yearly installment in repayment of principal will not be due until 31 December following simple interest only will be due on the intermediate 30" June; Note : These instructions are applicable mutatis mutandis to loans, the repayment of which are made by other than half yearly installments; It must be kept in view that, the calculation fixing the amount of equal periodical installments by which an advance is repaid with interest presupposes punctual payment of the installments, and that, if any installment is not punctually repaid, the fixed installment will not in the end discharge the loan. The amount recovered from a debtor will be adjusted towards the principal and interest in the ratio of 40:60 in case where interest is due along with the principal. Interest: Interest shall be charged at the rate prescribed by Government for any particular loan or for the class of loans concerned. A loan bears interest for the day of advance but not for the day of repayment. Default in Payments: (1) Any default in the payment of interest upon a loan or advance, or in the repayment of the principal, will be promptly reported by the Accountant General to the authority which sanctioned the loan or the advance. On receipt of such a report, the authority concerned shall immediately take steps to get the default remedied. (2) The responsibility of Accountant General under this rule refers only to the loans the detailed accounts for which are kept up by him. (3) The authority which sanctions a loan may in so far as the law allows, may prescribe interest at a higher rate or and provide for lower rate of interest in the case of punctual and prompt payments upon all over due installments with the sanction of

General to the authority which sanctioned the loan or the advance. On receipt of such a report, the authority concerned shall immediately take steps to get the default remedied. (2) The responsibility of Accountant General under this rule refers only to the loans the detailed accounts for which are kept up by him. (3) The authority which sanctions a loan may in so far as the law allows, may prescribe interest at a higher rate or and provide for lower rate of interest in the case of punctual and prompt payments upon all over due installments with the sanction of the Finance Department for each category and type of loans. Provisions to this effect shall also be made at the appropriate place of agreement as below: "The Loan will carry interest @........ % per annum, provided that if the installments of the principal and/or interest are paid punctually on the due dates, the rates shall be reduced to......% per annum". As regards the loan sanctioned in favour of Local Bodies and Industrial and Commercial Undertakings in the Public Sector the penalty clause in the existing form shall continue. Note: The penal or the higher rate of interest as the case may be shall not except under special orders of the Government be less than 2.5

Chunk 701:
% per annum above the normal rate of interest prescribed by Government from time to time for the loans advanced. (4) Calculation of higher rate of interest in Default: The higher rate of interest is attracted only in case of defaulted installments. It will apply from the due date of payment of previous installment till the date of actual payment of the delayed installment. Example : A loan of Rs. 3 lakhs was drawn by a third party on 1“ January 1988 and was repayable in 3 annual equal installments. The sanction letter stipulated that the loan would carry interest at 10.5

Chunk 702:
% per annum to be reduced to 8% for prompt payment. The first installment of Rs. 1 lakh together with interest @ 8% (i.e. Rs. 1,24,000 in all) was paid by the party on 01.01.

But in the case of loans to others where the sanction letters are worked as in the para (3) above, it would be invidious to charge interest at penal rates for the period of postponement only. In such cases, the competent authority has to work out the equated installments for every loan sanctioned both at the higher rate of interest as also at the lower rate. While the equated installments at the lower rate of interest will be paid by the borrowers on the due dates, in the event of default. They will pay the equated installments worked out with the higher rate of interest together with interest thereon at the same higher rate from the due date of its payment till the date of actual payment. In case equated installments calculated at the higher rate of interest, the principal and interest portion for the purposes of adjustments in accounts may be determined by taking the amount of principal as it would have been in case of equated installments at the lower rate of interest and the whole of the residuary amount shall be adjusted as interest. Irrecoverable Loans & Advances : (1) A competent authority may remit or write off any loans or advances owing to their irrecoverability or otherwise.

Sub: - Small Savings Scheme — Standardised Agency System — Fidelity Guarantee Policy for appointment of authorised agents. I am directed to state that the appointing authorities for Agents for the Small Savings Schemes under the Standardised Agency System are authorised to accept Fidelity Guarantee Policies furnished by applicants for an agency in lieu of cash security. A question has arisen whether a fresh policy will be necessary when an agent migrates from one state to another and desire to continue his agency. On migration of an agent from one State to another the area of operation and also the appointing authority change necessitating fresh Agreement to be executed by the Agent to the satisfaction of the Appointing Authority at the new place. In most of such cases, the period of the fidelity Guarantee Policy is not over before an agent migrates from one station to another. A question has, therefore, arisen whether a fresh policy is necessary or the existing policy could be accepted for the unexpired period by the Appointing Authority at the new place. 166 The Life Insurance Corporation of India who were addressed in the matter have no objection to continuing the same policy even after the area of operation of the Agent changes consequent to his migration to a new station. For this

On the expiry of the policy, the renewal may be obtained from the Divisional Office under whose, jurisdictions the Agent's new region falls, All communications in connection with the existing policy will have to be carried on with the Divisional Office which originally issued the policy. The arrangements suggested by the Life Insurance Corporation have been examined by the Government of India with a view to avoiding inconvenience to agents in claiming refund of premium for the unexpired period of the old policy full premium for a fresh policy, it has been decided by the Government of India that all such Fidelity Guarantee policies may be accepted by the Appointing Authorities after ascertaining from the issuing office of the Life Insurance Corporation the date up to which the policy will be in force and the concurrence of that office to the proposed transfer. The procedure outlined in paragraph 2 above may be followed invariably for this purpose. It is requested that all the Appointing Authorities may kindly be informed accordingly.

Budget heads exhibited in estimates of receipts and expenditure by the Government or in any order of appropriation shall ordinarily conform to the prescribed rules of classification. Any discrepancy shall be rectified in consultation with the Finance Department (Budget) at the earliest or at the stage of revised estimates and should this not be feasible for any reason, a note may to kept in the relevant accounts viz. : Appropriation Accounts and/or the Finance Accounts wherever necessary explaining the discrepancy. Il - CAPITAL AND REVENUE ACCOUNTS Capital Expenditure: (1) Expenditure of capital nature shall broadly be defined as expenditure incurred with the object of increasing concrete assets of a material and permanent character. (2) (3) (a) (b) (c) (4) (i) (ii) (b) Rule 339: (b) (c) 173 Expenditure on a temporary assets or grants-in-aid shall not ordinarily be considered as expenditure of a capital nature. Expenditure of a capital nature shall be distinguished from Revenue Expenditure both in the Budget estimates and in Government Accounts. Capital expenditure is generally met from receipts of a capital, debt, deposit of banking character as distinguished from ordinary revenues, derived from taxes, duties, fees, fines and similar items of current income including extraordinary receipts. It is open to the Government to meet capital expenditure from ordinary revenues provided there are sufficient revenue resources to cover this liability. Expenditure of a capital nature as defined above, incurred upon a scheme or project shall not be classed as capital expenditure in the Government accounts unless the classification has been expressly authorised by general or special orders of Government. Ordinarily, such classification will not be permitted unless:- It is essential for the exhibition of financial results of any special service or undertaking on the basis of generally accepted commercial principles, or in some other conventional manner, either that the cost of the service of undertaking may be ascertained or that the full implications of any policy may be clearly demonstrated;

Expenditure of a capital nature as defined above, incurred upon a scheme or project shall not be classed as capital expenditure in the Government accounts unless the classification has been expressly authorised by general or special orders of Government. Ordinarily, such classification will not be permitted unless:- It is essential for the exhibition of financial results of any special service or undertaking on the basis of generally accepted commercial principles, or in some other conventional manner, either that the cost of the service of undertaking may be ascertained or that the full implications of any policy may be clearly demonstrated; or In the case of public works there the cost individually exceeds Rs. | lakh or where the individual cost is below this limit but the works form part of the Scheme having a continuity of purpose, time and space and the cost of scheme as a whole exceeds Rs. 5 lakhs; or The expenditure involved is so large that it cannot reasonably be met from ordinary revenues. Capital Cost of Unproductive Work to be met from Ordinary Revenues (a) As a general rule, capital cost of an unproductive work is met from ordinary revenues. Borrowed money and other resources will not ordinarily be spent for unproductive purposes unless the following conditions are fulfilled:- the objects for which the money is needed are so urgent and vital that the expenditure can neither be avoided, postponed or distributed over a series of Years; and the amount is too large to be met from current revenues. productive works are those which produce sufficient revenue over the charges relevant to its functioning. Principles of allocation of expenditure between Capital and Revenue: (1)(a) Capital shall bear all charges for the first construction and equipment of a project as well as charges for intermediate maintenance of the work while not yet opened for service. It shall also bear charges for such further additions and improvements as may be sanctioned under rules made by competent authority. Subject to clause (c), revenue shall bear subsequent charges for maintenance and all working expenses. These embrace all expenditure on

Principles of allocation of expenditure between Capital and Revenue: (1)(a) Capital shall bear all charges for the first construction and equipment of a project as well as charges for intermediate maintenance of the work while not yet opened for service. It shall also bear charges for such further additions and improvements as may be sanctioned under rules made by competent authority. Subject to clause (c), revenue shall bear subsequent charges for maintenance and all working expenses. These embrace all expenditure on the working and upkeep of the project and also on such renewals and replacements and such additions, improvements and extensions as under rules made by Government are debitable to the revenue account. In the case of works of renewal and replacement, which pertain both if a capital and revenue nature, and allocation of expenditure shall be regulated by the broad principle that Revenue should pay or provide a fund for the adequate replacement of all wastage or depreciation of property originally provided out of capital grants and that only the cost of genuine improvements, whether determined by prescribed rules or formula, or under special orders of Government, may be debited to the Capital. Where under special orders of Government a Depreciation (d) (2) Rule 340: @) (ii) (iii) Rule 341: (2) @) (ii) (3) (4) 174 or Renewals Reserve Fund is established for renewing assets of any commercial department or undertaking, the distribution of expenditure or renewals and replacement between capital and the Fund shall be so regulated as to guard against over capitalisation in the on hand and excessive withdrawals from the Fund on the other. Expenditure on account of reparation of damage caused by extraordinary calamities, such as flood, fire, earthquake, enemy action, etc., shall be charged to Capital, or to Revenue, or dividend between them, in such way as may be determined by Government according to the circumstances of each case. Capital receipts in so far as they relate to expenditure or represent recoveries of expenditure previously

undertaking, the distribution of expenditure or renewals and replacement between capital and the Fund shall be so regulated as to guard against over capitalisation in the on hand and excessive withdrawals from the Fund on the other. Expenditure on account of reparation of damage caused by extraordinary calamities, such as flood, fire, earthquake, enemy action, etc., shall be charged to Capital, or to Revenue, or dividend between them, in such way as may be determined by Government according to the circumstances of each case. Capital receipts in so far as they relate to expenditure or represent recoveries of expenditure previously debited to capital accruing during the process of construction of a project, shall be utilised in reduction of capital expenditure. Thereafter treatment in the accounts will depend on circumstances, but except under special rule or order of Government they shall never be credited to the revenue account or the department or undertakings. Record of Capital Expenditure in Account : The following principles shall govern the record of capital expenditure in accounts:- The State Government should prescribe definite criteria for classifying as items of expenditure as pertaining to "Revenue” or "Capital" taking into account the nature and the magnitude of the expenditure involved. The source of financing (whether revenue budget or capital budget) should follow this classification. All claims of expenditure to be met from revenue according to the criteria indicated in (i) above shall be initially and finally debited to "revenue" and it is not permissible to debit such expenditure temporarily to a capital head pending its write back to revenue over a period of Years. The detailed rules by which allocation of expenditure between capital and revenue in commercial departments and undertakings should be determined, hall be such as may be made by the Government after consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Interest on Capital : (1) Except is special cases regulated by special orders of Government, interest at such rates as may be specified from time to time shall be charged in the accounts of all commercial Departments or Undertakings for which separate capital and

temporarily to a capital head pending its write back to revenue over a period of Years. The detailed rules by which allocation of expenditure between capital and revenue in commercial departments and undertakings should be determined, hall be such as may be made by the Government after consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Interest on Capital : (1) Except is special cases regulated by special orders of Government, interest at such rates as may be specified from time to time shall be charged in the accounts of all commercial Departments or Undertakings for which separate capital and revenue accounts are maintained within the Government accounts. For capital outlay met out of specific loans raised by Government, the interest shall be charged at such rate as may be prescribed by Government, having regard to the rate of interest, actually paid on such loans and the incidental charges incurred in raising and managing them. For capital outlay provided otherwise, interest shall be charged at the average rate of interest to be determined each Year by the Accountant General, with the approval of the Government. Method of Calculation of Interest: The interest shall be calculated on the direct capital outlay to the end of the previous Year plus half the outlay of the year itself, irrespective of whether such outlay has been met from current revenues or from other sources. Interest charged to Capital written Back : When under any special orders of Government, charges for interest during the process of construction of a project are temporarily met from capita, the writing back of capitalised interest shall from the first charge on any capital receipts or surplus revenue derived from the project when opened for working. Rule 342.

(1) (2) G) Rule 343: (2) Rule 344: @) (ii) 175 TI - GENERAL METHOD OF ACCOUNTING Classification and Accounting for transactions pertaining to more than one major head of account : For the sake of convenience or for other special reasons, receipts or expenditure pertaining to more than one head of account may be booked in the first instance under one of the heads concerned but the portion creditable or debitable to other head or heads involved should be transferred from the former head to the latter before the accounts of the year are closed. A few cases in which this procedure is authorised are cited below :- Where the charges for the supply of water from Irrigation canals are consolidated with the land revenue demand, the consolidated rates are in the first instance credited to the head "0029-Land Revenue" and an approximate amount calculated as the share due to irrigation is transferred to Irrigation Revenue head. Interest paid by Government loan is taken initially under the head "2049-Interest Payment" and necessary transfers from this head are made subsequently in respect of amounts debitable to Commercial Departments by credit to "0049-Interest Receipts". The Establishment and Tools and plant charges of public work divisions are in the first place, booked under a single Major head subject to final apportionment among the several major heads concerned. Accounts of Commercial Departments or Undertakings : (1) Where any departmental Undertakings of Government function on commercial lines, the essential formalities of commercial accounts of the Undertakings shall be kept outside the regular Government account. Gross receipts and expenditure of Commercial Departments or Undertakings shall be accounted for under the appropriate Major and Minor heads in the same way as ordinary receipts and expenditure of Government. The heads of accounts shall, as far as possible,

of public work divisions are in the first place, booked under a single Major head subject to final apportionment among the several major heads concerned. Accounts of Commercial Departments or Undertakings : (1) Where any departmental Undertakings of Government function on commercial lines, the essential formalities of commercial accounts of the Undertakings shall be kept outside the regular Government account. Gross receipts and expenditure of Commercial Departments or Undertakings shall be accounted for under the appropriate Major and Minor heads in the same way as ordinary receipts and expenditure of Government. The heads of accounts shall, as far as possible, be common to the Government account and the General Ledger maintained at the Department or Undertakings and should be selected with due regard to the principles of Governmental and Commercial accounting so that the monthly classified account of income and expenditure of the Department or Undertakings may be prepared readily from the General Ledger. Working expenses of Commercial Departments : As a general rule Receipts and Working expenses pertaining to Commercial Department or Undertakings shall be recorded on the Receipt or Working expenses in the expenditure side. Rectification of Misclassifications: The procedure to be followed in rectifying misclassifications in accounts shall be as under:- If an item which properly belongs to a Revenue or Expenditure head is wrongly classified under another Revenue or Expenditure head in the accounts of the same Government, the error shall be corrected at any time before the accounts of the year are closed, in the manner indicated in clause (f) below but after the accounts are closed no correction is admissible, it being sufficient to make suitable note of the error against the original entry. If, however, the error effects the receipts and payments of another Government or the transactions of a Commercial Department, it shall be corrected by transfer in all cases as soon as the error is discovered. The procedure to be observed for the correction of error in the accounts of work in the public works department shall be as laid down separately in Public Works Finance & Accounts Rules. An error

Chunk 772:
manner indicated in clause (f) below but after the accounts are closed no correction is admissible, it being sufficient to make suitable note of the error against the original entry. If, however, the error effects the receipts and payments of another Government or the transactions of a Commercial Department, it shall be corrected by transfer in all cases as soon as the error is discovered. The procedure to be observed for the correction of error in the accounts of work in the public works department shall be as laid down separately in Public Works Finance & Accounts Rules. An error which affects a debt, deposit or remittance head shall be corrected by transfer, however, old and however small it may be. If the accounts of the year in which the error took place are not closed, the correction shall be made by the removal of the item from the head under which it was wrongly taken to that to which it properly belongs. If the accounts of the Year in (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Rule 345: Rule 346: Rule 347: (2) (3) 176 which the error place are closed then the following procedure shall be followed in the cases referred to:- an item taken to one debt, deposit or remittance head instead of another, the correction shall be made by transfer from the one head to the other; an item credited to a debt, deposit or remittance head instead of to a revenue head, or debited to a debt deposit or remittance head instead of to an expenditure head, the correction shall be made by transfer to the head under which it should originally have appeared; an item credited to a revenue head instead of to a debt, deposit or remittance head, correction shall be made by debiting refunds and crediting the proper head; an item debited to an expenditure head instead of to a debt, deposit or remittance head, correction shall be made by debiting the proper head and by minus expenditure under the relevant expenditure head; after the accounts of the Year are closed, corrections or

Chunk 773:
debt deposit or remittance head instead of to an expenditure head, the correction shall be made by transfer to the head under which it should originally have appeared; an item credited to a revenue head instead of to a debt, deposit or remittance head, correction shall be made by debiting refunds and crediting the proper head; an item debited to an expenditure head instead of to a debt, deposit or remittance head, correction shall be made by debiting the proper head and by minus expenditure under the relevant expenditure head; after the accounts of the Year are closed, corrections or transfers affecting Capital major heads, unless they affect the accounts of different Governments, shall usually be affected without financial adjustment by alteration of progressive figures, without passing the debit and credit entries through the accounts of the Year's financial transactions. This would prevent unnecessary inflation of the current Year's accounts and the voting of grants of doubtful propriety which the inclusion of the correcting entries in the current accounts would otherwise involve; when errors are discovered in the same Year, involving a correction by transfer of amounts from one minor head to another under the same major head, or from one major head to another, the necessary corrections should be made by a formal transfer entry. But if the amount involved does not exceed ten rupees and affects only Revenue or Expenditure heads affecting the same Government, no formal transfer is necessary, and it should be sufficient simply to make a note of the error against the original entry. Accounts to work from Balance to Balance: The accounts of Government shall work from balance to balance. The closing balance shown in the account of each month shall work upto the General Cash balances of each Government head in its treasuries (including remittances in transit) and by the Bank entrusted with treasury business at the end of that month. Write off of balances from Debit, Deposit, Suspense and Remittance head : Ordinarily, all amounts due to Government which are found to be irrecoverable shall be written off from the debt head

The closing balance shown in the account of each month shall work upto the General Cash balances of each Government head in its treasuries (including remittances in transit) and by the Bank entrusted with treasury business at the end of that month. Write off of balances from Debit, Deposit, Suspense and Remittance head : Ordinarily, all amounts due to Government which are found to be irrecoverable shall be written off from the debt head of account concerned to an expenditure head as a loss to the Government. Similarly, any balance due by Government remaining unclaimed for such time as may be prescribed by Government concerned by debit to the Debt to Deposit head concerned. Classification of Recoveries of Expenditure:(1) 'Recovery' defined — Recovery means to denote repayment of payment by another department of the same Government or by another Government by a Non-Government party which initially incurred the charge and classified it in the accounts as final expenditure by debit to Revenue of Capital needs of accounts. Recoveries towards establishment charges, tools and plants, fee for inspection of stores, etc., effected at percentage rates or otherwise, are some example. Classification of Recoveries made from non-Government parties and other Government: Recoveries of expenditure from non-Government parties, other Governments and local funds shall in all cases be classified receipts of the Government rendering services of supplies. Classification of Recoveries as Reduction of Expenditure: In the following cases, the recoveries shall be taken in reduction of expenditure:- (i) (ii) (iii) (4) Rule 348: Rule 349: Rule 350: (2) (3) Rule 351: 177 When a Government undertake a service merely as an agent of a private body, so that the entire cost of the service is recovered from that body, the net cost to governing being "nil"; Receipts from sale proceeds of materials, plants, etc., received from old structure in case of work is in progress; and Transactions of ‘Stock & Suspense’ accounts in case of public works.

Chunk 775:
Classification of Recoveries as Reduction of Expenditure: In the following cases, the recoveries shall be taken in reduction of expenditure:- (i) (ii) (iii) (4) Rule 348: Rule 349: Rule 350: (2) (3) Rule 351: 177 When a Government undertake a service merely as an agent of a private body, so that the entire cost of the service is recovered from that body, the net cost to governing being "nil"; Receipts from sale proceeds of materials, plants, etc., received from old structure in case of work is in progress; and Transactions of ‘Stock & Suspense’ accounts in case of public works. In the case of projects jointly executed by several Governments, where the expenditure is to be shared by the participating Governments in agreed proportion, but expenditure is incurred by the Government and shares of another participating Governments recovered subsequently such recoveries from other Governments shall be exhibited as abatement of charges under the relevant expenditure head of account in the books of the Government incurring the expenditure initially. Recoveries by one Department from another Department of the same Government: As between different departments of the same Government, the recoveries shall be classified as deduction from the gross expenditure, except such recoveries as are made by a Commercial department which should be treated as receipts of that department. Note : The term "Recoveries by a Commercial department" for the purpose of this direction shall apply to recoveries in respect of services rendered to other departments in pursuance of the proper functions for which the department is constituted; Classification of Receipts and Recoveries on Capital Accounts: Receipts and recoveries on Capital Accounts in so far they represent recoveries of expenditure previously debited to a Capital Major head shall be taken in reduction of expenditure under the major head concerned except where the rules of allocation applicable to a particular department such receipts are taken as revenue receipts.

Note : The term "Government Servant" used in clause (2) of this Rule includes persons who, through not technically borne in a regular Government establishment are duly authorised to receive money on behalf of Government. Where losses of public money are wholly or partially met by non-payment of salary or pension and the Accounts department applies unpaid amount to meet the Government claim, the resultant balance of the claim alone shall be treated as a loss, the emoluments due being debited to the relevant head of account as it had been drawn and used by the Government servant concerned in paying the Government claim. Buildings, Lands, Stores and Equipment : Losses or deficiencies of buildings, lands, stores and equipments shall not be classified under a separate head in the accounts, though they shall Rule 352: (2) (3) (4) Rule 353: Rule 354: Rule 355 : (a) (2) 178 be written off from any value of commercial

[See rule 22(1)] Principle governing the assessment of responsibility: the cardinal principle governing the assessment of responsibility is that every Government servant should exert the same vigilance in respect of public expenditure and public funds generally as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in respect of expenditure and the custody of his own money. While, therefore, the competent authority may in special cases condone Government servant's honest errors of judgement involving financial loss, if he can show that he has acted in good faith and done his best upto the limits of his ability and experience, personal liability shall be strictly enforced against Government servants who are dishonest, careless or negligent in the duties entrusted to them. Higher officer also Responsible: In cases where loss is due to delinquencies of subordinate Government servants and where it appears that this has been facilitated by laxity of supervision on the part of higher officer, the later shall also be strictly called to account and his personal liability in the matter carefully assessed. (a)Enforcement of Pecuniary Liability-Principle: The question of enforcing pecuniary liability shall always be considered as well as the question of other forms of disciplinary action. In deciding the degree of Government Servant Pecuniary liability it will be necessary to look not only to the circumstances of the case but also to the financial circumstances of Government servant, since it should be recognised that the penalty should not be such as to impair his future efficiency. (b) Recovery of amount and its extent: In particular, if the loss has occurred through fraud, every endeavour shall be made to recover the whole amount lost from the guilty persons, and if laxity of supervision has facilitated

(b) Recovery of amount and its extent: In particular, if the loss has occurred through fraud, every endeavour shall be made to recover the whole amount lost from the guilty persons, and if laxity of supervision has facilitated the fraud, the supervising officer at fault may properly be penalised either directly by requiring him to make good in money a sufficient proportion of the loss or indirectly by reduction or stoppage of his increment of pay. (c) Assessment of value or Government Property Lost: It shall be considered whether the book value of government equipment lost, damaged or destroyed by the carelessness of individual entrusted with their care (i.e. bicycle, calculators, policeman's riffle, tools and equipments, vehicles, etc.) shall be recovered from the delinquent Government servant.
