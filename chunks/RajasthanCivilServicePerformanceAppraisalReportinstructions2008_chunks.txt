Chunk 44:
An employee should not, at any time, be kept ignorant of the opinion of his superior officers.Where his service is not considered satisfactory, criticism should be communicated promptly and should indicate, in suitable language, the nature of the defects in question.However, to convey only adverse remarks is rather discouraging and leaves the person concerned guessing as.to the general purport of his report.To avoid anxiety on this account the general total.impression of his report in brief should be conveyed to the person concerned (3)A certain degree of discretion should be made.in communicating reported defects of an irremediable nature.For instance, it might do more harm than good to inform a person year after year that his intelligence is below average or that he is unduly sensitive.

Chunk 45:
Similarly, remarks about the physical defects of the persons noted in the PAR a 14 need not be communicated. (4) While communicating the adverse comments, a mention of the good points should also be made.Similarly, where a report shows that a person has made successful efforts to remedy defects to which his . .attention has been drawn previously, it should be communicated to - him so that he may know that his efforts to improve have not passed un-noticed. (5)Only such of the adverse entries as are recorded and accepted by the reviewing/accepting authority, if any, need.be communicated.The reviewing/accepting authority should, therefore, normally indicate whether it agrees or.disagrees with the remarks of the reporting officer.

Chunk 46:
It should also record additional remarks, wherever necessary, if the report is too brief, cryptic or vague.Remarks in the cases in which judgement is suspended, should not be communicated.In the cases of Heads of Department and Secretaries, where there is a conflict between the remarks made in regard to an officer by the senior most officer and those made by the Minister-in-charge, in the - normal course, both remarks will continue to remain on the PAR and the adverse remarks of either authority would be communicated to the - officer concerned. (

Chunk 47:
6) Any adverse entry recorded in the PAR after it is completely filled up shall be communicated to the person concerned in writing by the authority in, whose custody the report is kept, in the prescribed time limit, asking the person to make representation, if so desired, within one month.This communication should be in writing and a record to that effect should be kept in the PAR dossier of the Government servant concerned (7)Great attention should be paid to the manner and method of communication in order to ensure that advice given in the warning or 5 -censure administered; whether orally or in writing’ shall, having regard to the temperament of the person concerned, be most beneficial to him.The.

Chunk 48:
memo, forwarding the adverse remarks to the person reported upon, should be couched in such a language that it does not produce 8 8७186 of resentment in the person reported upon and that it~ makes it clear to him that the intention of communicating these defects to him is that he tries to improve himself in respect of those Reve 15 - defects.हि (8)It is not necessary to disclose the identity of the officer who made the adverse remarks while communicating them to the Government servant concerned. (9)Only one representation against adverse remarks, which are recorded in the PAR of the Government servant, should be accepted within the prescribed time.

Chunk 49:
However, the competent authority may, in its discretion, entertain.a representation made beyond this time if there is satisfactory explanation for the delay (10) All representations against adverse remarks should.be decided expeditiously by the competent authority within the prescribed time— limit.Once a final decision regarding the adverse remarks has been taken, no notice will be taken of any representation received against the adverse remarks (11) The.

Chunk 51:
not required if the reporting/reviewing/accepting officer has retired or demitted the office (c) In case of state service officers, the file containing the PAR, the representation and comments thereon of the officer making the adverse remarks, if any, will be forwarded to.the Secretary to Government in the borrowing department who would record his views and also seek approval of the concerned Minister-in- charge directly, without the case.being routed through the Department of Personnel.The file would then come to DOP(A- 1/ACR) for further action in the matter.

Chunk 52:
In the event of difference of opinion between the Secretary to Government and the Minister-in—charge regarding the expunction of the adverse हि बीए 16 entry, the case shall be submitted to the Chief Minister through the Chief Secretary whose decision thereon shall be final.In case of other employees, the decision of the appointing authority shall be final.But in case the appointing authority itself has.recorded the adverse remarks, then the final decision regarding them will be taken by the-officer immediately superior to the appointing authority.

Chunk 54:
If it is felt that the adverse remarks should be toned down, | necessary entries should be made separately at the appropriate place of the report; the correction should not be made in the earlier entries themselves; and -iv.In the event of the competent.authority coming to the conclusion that the adverse remarks were inspired by malice or are entirely incorrect or unfounded, and therefore deserved expunction, he should score through the remark, paste it over, or obliterate it otherwise, and should make an entry, with his signature and date, stating that he had done-so (12) Representations or explanations against adverse entries: should not be added to the PARs.
