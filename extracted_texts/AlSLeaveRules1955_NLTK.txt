28(1) While a member of the Service is on foreign service in India contributions
towards the amount of leave salary shall be paid to the Government

contributions and to forfeit the right to count as duty in Government
service the time spent in foreign employ.

28(6) Neither the member of Service nor the foreign employer has any right of
property in a contribution paid and no claim for refund shall be
entertained.

Explanation—For the purpose of calculating the rate of leave salary admissible the
pay drawn in foreign service, less in the case of the member of the Service paying his
own contribution, such part of pay as may be paid as contribution, shall count as pay.

29. Extent of leave admissible to a probationer in case of termination of
service— If for any reason it is proposed to terminate the services of a member of the

cause undue hardship to a member of the Service, it may, after recording its reasons for
so doing and notwithstanding anything contained in any of these rules, deal with the
case of such member in such manner as may appear to it to be just and equitable:

Provided that the case shall not be dealt with in any manner less favouable to such
member than that prescribed in these rules.

 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA’S DECISIONS

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA’S ORDERS UNDER RULE 2

1. Joining time, pay and Transfer allowance is not entitled to a probationer, who
subsequently joins IAS before completion of the earlier IPS probation, though
carry forward of earned leave is permissible: - A question arose whether the past
service, as an |.P.S. probationer, or an |.A.S. Probationer would count for purpose of
joining time, leave etc.

2. The attributes of a substantive holder of a post that a probationer enjoys can apply to
the Service or Post in which he is on probation. Consequently, on his appointment to
the |.A.S. before completion of his probationary period in the |.P.S. the officer is to be
treated as the non—substantive holder of a post in the |.P.S. He will therefore not be
entitled to joining time, joining time pay and transfer allowance under the Government of
India’s decision No.4 below F.R. 105.

3. The carry forward of the leave earned by the officers as an I.P.S probationer is
permissible, as it does not depend on his status, permanent or temporary.

[G.I. M.H.A. letter No. 14/12/62—AIS(I) dated 28" November, 1962]

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA’S ORDERS UNDER RULE 10

1. Procedure for crediting earned leave for Govt. Servants.- The Fourth Pay
Commission, vide its report in para 26.2, made the following recommendations:—

2. The present procedure of crediting E.L. in two instalments of 15 days each on January
1% and July 1° of every calendar year may be reviewed to remove disadvantages to
employees in cases where they have already accumulated 180 days of E.L. (now 240
days) before January 1* or July 1°.

3. The above recommendation was considered and accepted by the Government. This
was implemented with effect from 1.1.90 in the manner indicated below.

(i) In case of officers, having at their credit E.L of 225 days or less as on 1*
January/1* July of a year, Earned Leave of 15 days or proportionately less in
respect of retiring persons or those leaving service during the next half year
may continue to be credited to their leave account in advance as at present.

(ii) In case of officers, having at their credit E.L. of 225 days or less as on ‘st
January / 1 July of a year, Earned Leave of 15 days may be kept separately
and first adjusted against any E.L. that the officer may take during the ensuing
half year and the balance if any credited to the earned leave account at the
close of the half year subject to the ceiling of 240 days . If the earned leave
taken during the half year is more than 15 days the amount in excess of 15
days will however, have to be debited to the leave account.

For example:—

(1) if as on 1.1.90 the officer has at his credit earned leave of 225 days, 15 days
earned leave will be credited in advance to his leave account provided he is
not due to retire during the ensuing half year;

(2) if on 1.1.90 the officer has at his credit 240 days earned leave and (a) if he
avails 15 days‘ earned leave during the period 1.1.90 to 30.6.90, the earned
leave so taken will be adjusted against the 15 days’ earned leave kept

20
 separately to be credited to his account as on 1.1.90. He will thus have at his
credit as on 1.7.90, 240 days’ earned leave and (b) if on the other hand he
takes only 10 days earned leave during the half year ending 30.6.90 such
leave will be adjusted against the earned leave of 15 days to be credited to his
earned leave account on 1.1.90. No further leave will, however, be credited to
his earned leave account and the earned leave at his credit as on 1.7.90 will
continue to be 240 days.

(3) if as on 1.1.90 the officer has 230 days earned leave at his credit and (a) if he
takes 15 days earned leave during the half year ending 30.6.90 such leave will
be adjusted against the 15 days earned leave to be credited to his account on
1.1.90 and the earned leave at credit as on 1.7.90 will remain 230 days (b) if,
however, he takes only 10 days earned leave during the same half year, this
will first be adjusted against the 15 days earned leave to be credited as on
1.1.90 and the balance of 5 days will be credited to his leave account so that
as on 1.7.90 the earned leave at his credit will be 235 days.

days and 240 days , wherever occurring in the said letter, will be replaced by the figures
285 and 300 days respectively.

the members of the All India Services, vide Notification No. 11019/6/97—AlIS(III) dated
3 march 1998, which was made effective from 1° of July 1997. These instructions will
also come into effect from 1® of July 1997. The State Governments etc., may kindly

automatically by the administrative authorities when the officer furnishes his joining
report. In case he wishes to go back at a later time to bring his family etc., he may avail
of any leave due to him for that purpose.

[No.11019/9/93—AIIS(III) dated 15.7.93 & 6.12.93]

year provided that the authority competent to grant leave has reason to believe that the
Government servant will return to duty on its expiry.

[G.I. MHA letter No. 1/133/63—AlIS(Il)—dated 2nd December, 1963.]

3. Previous services rendered by IAS/IPS/IFS probationers under Central
Government before their appointment to these services, should count for leave if
the service is continuous: - Clarifications have been sought by some Accountants
General as to how the leave salary of IAS/IPS probationers in respect of their past
service under the Central Government is to be allocated and whether prior concurrence
of the Central Ministry/Department concerned is necessary in this regard.

2. It is clarified that all previous services rendered by IAS/IPS/IFS probationers under the
Central Government before their appointment to these Services, should count for leave if
the service is continuous. The leave salary in such cases has to be allocated on the
analogy of the provisions contained in Rule 9 of Part IIB of Appendix 3 to Accounts Code
Vol. |. The concurrence of the concerned Ministry of Government of India is not
necessary. However intimation may be sent to them in this regard. As regards
probationers, who were working under the State Government before their appointment to
the IAS/IPS/IFS their previous service shall count for leave provided the State
Government under whom they were working, agree to pay the leave salary.

[Letter No. 1/19/72—AIS (Ill), dated 13th October, 1972]

4. Encashment of leave to the moS serving under the State Government will be
regulated by the State Rules: - A point has been raised whether orders issued by
some State Governments in regard to the encashment of leave to its employees could
be extended to members of the All India Services working under them under rule 2(b) of
the All India Services (Conditions of Service—Residuary Matters) Rules, 1960. It is
clarified that encashment of leave to members of the AIS serving under the State
Government is a matter relating to conditions of service and since there is no provision
in any of the rules made under the All India Services Act, 1951 for encashment of leave,
in the case of the members of the Service serving in connection with affairs of the State
are to be regulated in accordance with the rules, regulations and orders applicable to
members of the State Civil Service, Class | in terms of Rule 2(b) of the AIS (Conditions
of Service—Residuary Matters) Rules, 1960.

2. It is further clarified that in accordance with the provisions contained in rule 2(a) of the
Rules referred to in the previous paragraph members of the All India Service serving in
connection with affairs of the Union are governed by the rules, regulations and orders as

23
 applicable to the Central Civil Service Group ‘A’. As the benefit of leave encashment is
not available to the members of Central Civil Services, Group ‘A’, members of the AIS
serving in connection with the affairs of the Union are not entitled to this benefit. It is,
therefore, not correct to sanction leave encashment to members of the All India
Services, who are serving in connection with the affairs of the Union.

[G.I., DP & AR letter No. 14/1/70—AlIS (Ill), dated 28th June, 1975 and No.
11019/6/81—AIS(III), dated 21-9-81].

5. Encashment of Earned Leave during the service is not allowed to the members
of the All India Services under the State Rules: - | am directed to invite attention to
this Department's letter No. 14/1/70-AIS(III) dated the 28" June, 1975, wherein it had
been clarified that encashment of leave to members of the AIS serving under the State
Government is a matter relating to conditions of service and since there is no provision
in any of the rules made under the All India Services Act, 1951 for encashment of leave,
matters relating to encashment of leave in the case of members of the service serving in
connection with affairs of the State are to be regulated in accordance with the rules,
regulations and orders applicable to members of the State Civil Services, Class | in
terms of Rule 2(b) of the AIS (Conditions of Services — Residuary Matters) Rules, 1960.

2. Further clarification was issued vide this Department's letter No. 11019/8/81-AlS(III)
dated 21% September, 1981 that in accordance with the provisions contained in Rule
2(a) of the All India Services (Conditions of Service — Residuary Matters) Rules, 1960,
members of the All India Services who are serving in connection with the affairs of the
Union are governed by the rules, regulations and orders as applicable to the Central
Civil Services Group ‘A’. Such members of the All India Services, who are serving in
connection with the affairs of the Union, are therefore, not entitled to the benefit of leave
encashment as per the rules of the State Government.

3. A provision for encashment of leave on superannuation has since been incorporated
as Rule 20 -A in the All India Services (Leave) Rules, 1955 vide Notification No.
11019/7/93-AlS-Ill dated the 22" December, 1993. The members of the All India
Services are, therefore, no longer entitled to the benefit of encashment of leave under
any of the rules of the State Government. It is, therefore, requested that no benefit
under the rules of the State Government should be allowed to the members of the All
India Services. However, no deductions may be made towards encashment of leave
availed of by the members of AIS prior to the issue of these instructions from the leave
outstanding at their credit at the time of superannuation.

[DOPT letter No. 11019/34/2003-AlS-III dated 19.01.2005]

6. No encashment of leave while in service shall be allowed to any member of All
India Services under any rules of the State Government except as provided in the
All India Service Rules.: - | am directed to refer to this Department's letter of even
number dated 19" January, 2005 wherein it was decided that members of the All India
Services would not be entitled to the benefit of encashment of leave under any of the
rules of the State Government. However, encashment of earned leave subject to the
maximum of 300 days can be allowed on retirement/death of the member of the Service
under rule 20A of the All India Services(Leave) Rules, 1955.

2. This Department has received a number of requests from the State Governments for
allowing encashment of leave to the members of the All India Services working under

24
 them under the provisions of the State Rules, which is otherwise applicable to
employees of that particular State Government.

3. It is hereby clarified that the provision under rule 20A of the AlS(Leave) Rules, 1955
was inserted vide Department of Personnel and Training's Notification No.11019/6/97-
AIS-111 dated 3rd March, 1998 (made effective from 01.07.1997), wherein the maximum
days for encashment of earned leave was increased from 240 days to 300 days which
can only be allowed at the time of retirement/death of the member of the Service. Apart
from this, pursuant to the recommendation of the Sixth Central Pay Commission, the
Central Government officers are allowed to encash ten days earned leave at the time of
availing of Leave Travel Concession (LTC) to the extent of sixty days during the entire
career. The leave encashed at the time of LTC will not be deducted from the maximum
amount of earned leave encashable at the time of retirement. It is further clarified that
where both husband and wife are Government servants, the present entitlement for
availing LTC shall remain unchanged, and encashment of leave equal to 10 days at the
time of availing of LTC will continue to be available to both, subject to a maximum of
sixty days each during the career. This provision has been made applicable to the Alii
India Services Officers vide this Department's letter No.11022/2/2008-AlS(Il) dated 7th
October, 2008.

4. There is no other provision for encashment of earned leave while in service under the
rules applicable to the members of All India services. Therefore, members of the All
India Services are entitled for encashment, of earned leave for 10 days each subject to
the maximum of 60 days in the entire career; and a maximum of 300 days of earned
leave on retirement/death under rule 20A of the All India Services(Leave) Rules, 1955.
No member of the Service should be allowed encashment of earned leave during
service, other than mentioned above, under any rule of the State Government.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA’S ORDERS UNDER RULE 21

1. Prior approval of the Government of India should be obtained under the
respective Cadre Rules before negotiating for or taking up any employment by
members of the All India Services:- | am directed to invite attention to this
Department's letter No. 11017/47/2005-AlS-Ill, dated the 27th December, 2005, under
which instructions reiterating the provisions of Rule 13(1)(b) of the All India Service
(Conduct) Rules, 1968 were issued, stating that all the members of the All India Services
should obtain prior permission of the Government before negotiating for or undertaking
any other employment.

2. The service conditions of All India Service Officers are governed according to the
rules framed by the Central Government in consultation with the State Governments
under the All India Services Act, 1951.

3. Some State Governments like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have
brought in employment schemes under which officers of the State Government are
allowed to serve private organisations on extraordinary leave. They have, however,
implemented these schemes for the All India Services officers also.

4. The issue has been examined in the light of the relevant rules, in consultation with the
Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law &Justice.

25
 5. The main rules dealing with the cadre management of All India Services are the
Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, the Indian Police Service (Cadre)
Rules, 1954 and the Indian Forest Service (Cadre) Rules, 1966. According to sub-rule
(1) of Rule 6, a cadre officer may be deputed for the service under the Central
Government or another State Government or under a company etc. which is wholly or
substantially owned or controlled by the Central Government or by another State
Government only with the concurrence of the State Government and the Central
Government. Sub rule (2) (ii) of Rule 6 provides that a cadre officer may be deputed for
service under an international organisation, an autonomous body not controlled by the
Government, or a private body, by the Central Government in consultation with the State
Government on whose cadre he is borne. The State Government can depute for service
only under a body wholly or substantially owned or controlled by the State Government,
a Municipal Corporation or a Local Body of the State cadre where the officer is borne
under rule 6(2)(i) of the respective Cadre Rules.

6. Rule 13(1) of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 provides that no member of
the All India Service can negotiate for or undertake any employment without the
approval of the Government. Rule 21(1) of the All India Services (Leave) Rules, 1955
provides that a member of the Service on leave shall not take any service or accept any
employment without obtaining the permission of the Government. These rules have
limited scope with regard to 'conduct' and ‘leave' provisions with reference to All India
Service officers and deputation of All India Services is governed by Rule 6 of the
respective Cadre Rules. Deputation to an international organisation, an autonomous
body not controlled by the Government, or a private body is only possible under rule
6(2)(ii) of the respective All India Service Cadre Rules for which the Cadre Authority is
the Central Government.

7. Rule 13(1) of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 and Rule 21(1) of the All
India Services (Leave) Rules, 1955 read with the provisions of the Cadre Rules thus
make it explicitly clear that approval of the Government of India is essential for allowing
a member of the All India Service for undertaking any employment outside the State
Government on leave of any kind.

8. It has, therefore, been decided that no member of the All India Service should be
allowed by the State Governments to undertake any private employment after taking
leave from the State Government and all such cases should be referred to the
Government of India for approval and necessary permission for service under an
international organisation, an autonomous body not controlled by the Government or a
private body under the Rule 6(2)(ii) of the respective All India Service Cadre Rules.

9. All the cases in which State Governments have allowed the members of All India
Services to take up employment under the provisions of these rules, should be referred
to the respective All India Service Cadre Controlling Authorities for approval under the
provisions of Rule 6(2)(ii) of the respective All India Service Cadre Rules within one
month of the date of issue of this letter.

26
 the A.I.S. (Leave) Rules, 1955, in regard to the All India Service Officers working in or
under each Ministry/Department.

(G.I. letter No. 11019/7/78—AIS (Ill), dated 12th April, 1978)

Ministries/Departments of the Government of India for grant of ex-India leave: -

the State Governments. Any excess will be granted by Department of Personnel &
Training: - | am directed to refer to this Deptt’s earlier letter No. 6/6/71—AIS.III, dated
11.1.1974 and the Ministry of Finance (Deptt. of Expd.) O.M.No. 19036/7/75—E.IV(B),
dated 8.5.1976 which have been extended in the case of All India Services Officers and
No. 19036/7/76/E.IV(B), dated 15.3.1978 in regard to the terms & conditions of
deputation abroad of All India Services Officers.

2. A question has been raised in regard to the period of leave admissible to All India
Services Officers on deputation when such leave is taken in conjunction with deputation
(including training) abroad.

3. As per the existing provisions in the All India Services (Leave) Rules, 1955, there is
no bar to an officer spending abroad a part or whole of the leave sanctioned to him by
the competent authority as per these rules. However, restrictions have been imposed in
regard to the amount of leave an officer can be granted while abroad, including training
abroad, in conjunction with such deputation. Presently, it has been provided that an
officer may, subject to the exigencies of public service, be granted leave while abroad for
a period not exceeding 50 percent of the actual period of duty abroad (excluding the

Governments and the Ministries/Departments of the Government of India for grant
of ex-India leave: - | am directed to say on the subject mentioned above that an
Executive Instruction ‘B’ was issued by this Department (Letter No. 9/26/71-AlS-III) on

is provided that all cases, in which the State Government proposes to send a member of
an All India Service abroad on deputation or on leave due and admissible to him
(including study leave) should be referred to the respective Cadre Controlling Authority
in the Government of India.

2. There has been demand for doing away with the aforementioned provision for Central
Government's prior approval for grant of ex-India leave excluding study leave so as to

27
 avoid delay both at the level of the State Government and Central Government. After
careful consideration, it has now been decided to modify the existing provision and
stipulate that the approval of the Central Government for travel abroad of members
of the All India Service is no longer required in the following cases to the extent provided
therein:-

(a) In case of private visits abroad on leave due and admissible, the delegation is
restricted to Casual leave, Earned leave and Leave on Medical Certificate.

official visit/tour abroad subject to the condition that the total period abroad
(including travel time) should not exceed three (3) weeks.

to three (3) weeks duration where the entire expenses are borne by the
Government of India, the State Government, an International Agency such as the

which India is a member.

(d) Project related visits as defined in the OM No. 37/15/97-EO(F) dated 05.03.1999,

leave to proceed abroad, all the State Governments/Ministries to the Government of
India are requested to satisfy themselves regarding the funding of such visits made by
the officer concerned in each case and to see that no cadre officer accepts hospitality
from a foreign government/private body other than a close relative.

4. It is further noted that the above delegation will not apply to any travel abroad in
conjunction with leave granted under the provisions of the All India Service (Study
Leave) Regulations, 1960, where the specific clearance of the Central Government is
invariably required.

5. The following category of official visits/tours/study tours/seminars/workshops etc.
abroad will continue to be referred to DOP&T for grant of cadre clearance:

(iv) all cases where an officer is getting any remuneration/fees for the work
performed by him

6. The proposal should be sent in a self-contained format furnishing all the relevant
