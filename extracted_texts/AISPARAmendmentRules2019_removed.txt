General guidelines for filling up the PAR form for Indian Administrative Service officers except the level of
Secretary or Additional Secretary or equivalent to the Government of India.

1. Introduction

11, The Performance Appraisal Report is an important document. It provides the basic and vital inputs for further
development of an officer. The officer reported upon, the Reporting Authority, Reviewing Authority and the Accepting
Authority should therefore, undertake the duty of filling up the form with a high sense of responsibility.

12 Performance appraisal should be used as a tool for career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental
exercise. Reporting Authorities should realize that the objective is to develop an officer so that he/she realizes his/her
true potential. It is not meant to be a fault finding process but a developmental tool. The Reporting Authority, the
Reviewing Authority and the Accepting Authority should not shy away from reporting shortcomings in performance,
attitudes or overall personality of the officer reported upon.

13 The columns should be filled with due care and attention and after devoting adequate time. Any attempt to fill
the report in a casual or superficial manner will be easily discernible to the higher authorities.

1.4 Although the actual documentation of performance appraisal is a year-end exercise, in order that it may be a
tool for human resource development, career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental exercise, the
Reporting Authority and the officer reported upon should meet during the course of the year at regular intervals to
review the performance and to take necessary corrective steps.

2s Section-I

2.1 This Section should be filled up in the Administration Division, Personnel Department. Period of report could
either be the entire reporting year, namely, from 17 of April to 31 March or a part of the year (exceeding 3 months). In
case the period of report is a full year, it should be indicated accordingly; for example, 2007-2008. In case the period of
report is less than the entire year, specific start and end dates should be indicated, for example, 10" September 2007 -
31° March 2008.

2.2 Information on the present grade (pay-scale) as well as present post (actual designation and organization) and
the date from which he/she has been on his/her present post needs to be mentioned.

 [ भाग 1-खण्ड 30) ] भारत का राजपत्र : असाधारण 51

2.3 In the table relating to reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities the name and designation of the reporting
and reviewing authorities should be mentioned so that the officer reported upon is clear about whom he/she is required to
send the report.

24 The period of absence from duty, on leave, training, or for other reasons, should also be mentioned in this
section in the table provided for the purpose. Details of the training attended, date of filing of property returns and
whether the officer reported upon has reported/reviewed and the annual performance report of all his/her subordinate
officers for the previous year should be mentioned in the table for the purpose.

2.5 This Section provides for regular annual medical examination. The health check is mandatory for all officers
above the age of 40 and may be totally dispensed with for officers below the age of 40, except in case of medical
incident. A copy of the summary of the medical report is to be attached to the PAR Form by the Admin./Personnel
Department. The format of the health check up and the summary of medical report will be as circulated by the Cadre
Controlling Authority, after consultation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

3. Section-II

3.1 The officer reported upon is first required to give brief description of his/her duties and responsibilities, which
would normally not exceed about 100 words. Ideally, this should be in bullet form.

32 All officers are required to develop a work plan for the year and agree upon the same with the reporting officer.
The work plan should incorporate the relative annual work rhythm and budgetary cycle. This exercise is to be carried out
at the beginning of the year and finalized by 30" April, positively. In case of a change of the reporting officer during the
year, the work plan agreed with the previous reporting officer would continue to apply. The work plan agreed upon at the
beginning of the year has to be reviewed again during the month of September/October as a mid-year exercise and
finalized by 31* October. Based on this review the work plan may undergo some changes from that originally prepared.

33 After the work plan is prepared, it is possible that the officer reported upon is transferred out. There need not be
more than one work plan for one post each year. The period spent by the officer during the year and his contribution
could be considered for evaluating his performance against the work plan. In the case of mid-term transfers, continuity
and assessment of work and the lower performance profile in the first quarter should be taken into consideration.

3.4 The work plans, duly signed by the officer reported upon and the reporting authority has to be submitted to the
reviewing authority for his/her perusal and custody. The performance appraisal form provides for an assessment of the
accomplishments vis-a-vis the work plan agreed at the commencement of the year and reviewed mid- year. The officer
reported upon is required to fill up the table provided for the purpose in Section-II.

35 It is not necessary that the work plan should be entirely quantitative in nature. While for field level posts, the
work plan would consist essentially of quantifiable targets, for secretarial level posts it would consist of policy objectives
to be achieved etc.

3.6 Section II also provides an opportunity for the officer to reflect upon his/her performance during the year and
indicate one item which he/she thought was a significant contributions made by him/her during the year. It is always
possible for any officer to make significant contribution even in activities otherwise regarded as routine in nature.
Examples of such contribution may be the successful organization of a major event like the Kumbh Mela or successful
conclusion of an activity that has been going on for a long time, or even successful dealing of an emergency (e.g. major
earth quake/flood) would certainly be an exceptional contribution.

3.7 The officer reported upon is required to indicate specific areas in which he/she feels the need to upgrade skills
and attend training programs. He/she should also mention the specific steps that he/she has taken or proposes to take to
upgrade his/her skills in the identified area.

3.8 There is an increased emphasis on competency building in the new performance appraisal and career
progression system. There would be a premium on competency and skill upgradation. Hence, all officers are advised,
through a note in Section II, to keep the cadre controlling authority informed, at least once in five years, of all
educational and training programs attended, including the details of marks/grades secured in such programs, details of
professional papers published. These would be taken into account in the future career progression.

3.9 This Section also requires the officer reported upon to record certain certificates about submission of property
returns, annual medical check up and setting up of annual work plan for whom he/she would be the reporting authority.

4. Section-III

4.1 Section वा requires the reporting authority to comment on Section II as filled out by the officer reported upon,
and specifically state whether he/she agrees with the responses relating to the accomplishments. In case of disagreement
the reporting authority should highlight the specific portions with which he/she is unable to agree and the reasons for
such disagreement.
 52 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY [Part II—SEc. 3(i)]

42 This Section then requires the reporting authority to comment on the skill upgradation needs as identified by the
officer.
43 Thereafter, this Section requires the reporting authority to record a numerical grade in respect of the workout

put of the officer reported upon both in respect of the planned work as well as the unforeseen tasks. A numerical grade is
also required in respect of the “quality” of the output. In doing so, the reporting authority should take into account the
costs incurred (whether the officer reported upon has been cost conscious), the time taken and whether the laid down
rules/procedures have been adhered to in accomplishing the tasks.

44 The reporting authority is also required to record a numerical grade in respect of work output, personal
attributes and functional competencies.

4.5 Section III requires the reporting authority to comment on the integrity of the officer reported upon. In
recording remarks with regard to integrity, he/she need not limit him/herself only to matters relating to financial integrity
but could also take into account the moral and intellectual integrity of the officer reported upon. The following procedure
should be followed in filling up the column relating to integrity:

(i) If the Officer’s integrity is beyond doubt, it may be stated.
(ii) If there is any doubt or suspicion, the column should be left blank and action taken as under:

(a) A separate secret note should be recorded and followed up. A copy of the note should also be sent together
with the Performance Appraisal Report to the next superior officer who will ensure that the follow up action is
taken expeditiously. Where it is not possible either to certify the integrity or to record the secret note, the
Reporting Officer should state either that he/she had not watched the officer’s work for sufficient time to form a
definite judgement or that he/she has heard nothing against the officer, as the case may be.

(b) If, as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are cleared, the officer’s integrity should be
certified and an entry made accordingly in the Performance Appraisal Report.

(c) If the doubts or suspicions are confirmed, this fact should also be recorded and duly communicated to the
officer concerned.

(d) If as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are neither cleared nor confirmed, the officers
conduct should be watched for a further period and thereafter action taken as indicated at (b) and (c) above.

4.6 The reporting authority is also required to record a descriptive pen-picture on the overall qualities of the officer
reported upon and his/her performance including his attitude towards weaker sections. This need not exceed about 50
words and should try to cover overall qualities of the officer including areas of strengths and lesser strengths. The pen-
picture is also meant to be a qualitative supplement to the quantitative assessments made earlier part of this section.

47 Reporting authority is then required to make recommendations relating to domain assignment. The list of
domains is at para 10.

4.8 Finally, the reporting authority is required to record an overall grade. This should also be done on a scale of 1-
10, with 1 referring to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.

5. Section-IV

dL This Section is to be filled up by the reviewing authority. He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the

assessments made by the reporting officer. In case of disagreement, he/she may record his/her own assessment against
the work output or any of the attributes in the column specifically provided for the purpose. In case of agreement, he/she
need not fill in the column meant for him/her in the attributes/work output tables. Finally, the reviewing authority is
required to record an overall grade in the scale of 1-10.

6. Section-V

6.1 This Section is to be filled by the accepting authority. He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the
assessments made by the reporting authority/reviewing authorities. In case of difference of opinion, he/she is required to
give details and reasons for the same in the column specifically provided for the purpose in the table in Section V.

Ts Numerical Grades

7A At several places, numerical grades are to be awarded by reporting and review authorities. These should be on a
scale of 1-10, where 1 refers to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest. It is expected that any grading of 1 or 2 (against
work output or attributes or overall grade) would be adequately justified in the pen-picture by way of specific failures
and similarly, any grade of 9 or 10 would be justified with respect to specific accomplishments. Grades of 1-2 or 9-10
 [ भाग 1-खण्ड 30) ] भारत का राजपत्र : असाधारण 53

are expected to be rare occurrences and hence the need to justify them. In awarding a numerical grade the reporting,
reviewing and accepting authorities should rate the officer against a larger population of his/her peers that may be
currently working under them or would have worked under them in the past.

बडे Weightage and Mean

Weights have been assigned to work output, personal attributes and functional competency. The overall grade
will be based on the addition of the mean value of each group of indicators in proportion to weightage assigned.

8. Disclosure

8.1 There should be more openness in the system of appraisal. The annual PAR, including the overall grade and
integrity, should be communicated to the officer reported upon after it has been finalized by the accepting authority.

8.2. Representation

The officer reported upon may have the option to give his comments on the PAR. Such comments may be restricted
to the specific factual observations contained in the Performance Appraisal Report leading to the assessment of the
officer in terms of attributes, competency and _ output. If comments are submitted, the
Reporting/Reviewing/Accepting Authority would have the option to accept them and modify the PAR accordingly.
If the comments are not accepted, the views of the Reporting/Reviewing/Accepting Authority would be
communicated with reasons to the officer reported upon. Thereafter, only if the officer reported upon so desires, he
may request for the matter to be forwarded to the Referral Board. The representation shall be confined to errors of
facts and nothing else. The Referral Board shall give clear findings on the representation and take a final decision on
the assessment, including the overall grading in regard to the parameters affected thereby. The decision along with
details in case an entry is upgraded or downgraded with, reasons for same may be recorded in the PAR and the same
communicated to the officer reported upon. The decision of the Referral Board shall be final.

General guidelines for filling up the PAR form for Indian Administrative Service officers of the level of Secretary
or Additional Secretary or equivalent to the Government of India.

1. Introduction

1.1. The Performance Appraisal Report is an important document. It provides the basic and vital inputs for further
development of an officer. The officer reported upon, the Reporting Authority, the Reviewing Authority and the
Accepting Authority should, therefore, undertake the duty of filling up the form with a high sense of responsibility.

1.2 Performance appraisal should be used as a tool for career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental
exercise. Reporting Authorities should realize that the objective is to develop an officer so that he/she realizes his/her
true potential. It is not meant to be a fault finding process but a developmental tool. The Reporting Authority, the
Reviewing Authority and the Accepting Authority should not shy away from reporting shortcomings in performance,
attitudes or overall personality of the officer reported upon.

1.3 The columns should be filled with due care and attention and after devoting adequate time. Any attempt to fill
the report in a casual or superficial manner will be easily discernible to the higher authorities.

1.4 Although the actual documentation of performance appraisal is a year-end exercise, in order that it may be a
tool for human resource development, career planning and training, rather than a mere judgmental exercise, the
Reporting Authority and the officer reported upon should meet during the course of the year at regular intervals to
review the performance and to take necessary corrective steps.

2. Section-I

2.1 This Section should be filled up in the Administration Division/Personnel Deptt. Period of report could either be
the entire reporting year, namely, from 1“ of April to 317 March or a part of the year (exceeding 3 months). In case the
period of report is a full year, it should be indicated accordingly; for example, 2007-2008. In case the period of report is
less than the entire year, specific start and end dates should be indicated, for example, 10" September 2007 - 31“ March
2008.

2.2 Information on the present grade (pay-scale) as well as present post (actual designation and organization) and
the date from which he/she has been on his/her present post needs to be mentioned.

2.3 In the table relating to reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities the name and designation of the reporting,
reviewing and accepting authorities should be mentioned so that the officer reported upon is clear about whom he/she is
required to send the report to.

2.4 The period of absence from duty, on leave, training, or for other reasons, should also be mentioned in this
section in the table provided for the purpose. Details of the training attended date of filing of property returns and
whether the officer reported upon has reported/reviewed should be mentioned in the table for the purpose and annual
performance report of all his/her subordinate officers for the previous year.
 62 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY [Part II—SEc. 3(i)]

2:5 This Section provides for regular annual medical examination. The health check is mandatory for all officers
above the age of 40 and may be totally dispensed with for officers below the age of 40, except in case of medical
incident. A copy of the summary of the medical report is to be attached to the PAR Form by the Admin./Personnel
Department. The format of the health check up and the summary of medical report will be as circulated by the Cadre
Controlling Authority, after consultation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

3: Section-I1

3.1 This Section requires the officer reported upon to record certain certificates about submission of property
returns, annual medical check up, setting up of annual work plan for whom he/she would be the reporting authority as
well as for himself. The officer has to report on the preparation of the work plan for himself and has the option to enclose
a note on the important achievements during the period.

4. Section-III
4.1 The reporting authority is required to record a numerical grade in respect of certain attributes and work output.
4.2 This Section requires the reporting authority to record a numerical grade in respect of the work output of the

officer reported upon both in respect of the planned work as well as the unforeseen tasks. A numerical grade is also
required in respect of the “quality” of the output. In doing so, the reporting authority should take into account the costs
incurred (whether the officer reported upon has been cost conscious), the time taken and whether the laid down
tules/procedures have been adhered to in accomplishing the tasks.

43 Section III requires the reporting authority to comment on the integrity of the officer reported upon. In
recording remarks with regard to integrity, he/she need not limit him/herself only to matters relating to financial integrity
but could also take into account the moral and intellectual integrity of the officer reported upon. The following procedure
should be followed in filling up the column relating to integrity:

(i) If the Officer’s integrity is beyond doubt, it may be stated.
(ii) If there is any doubt or suspicion, the column should be left blank and action taken as under:

(a) A separate secret note should be recorded and followed up. A copy of the note should also be sent together
with the Performance Appraisal Report to the next superior officer who will ensure that the follow up action is
taken expeditiously. Where it is not possible either to certify the integrity or to record the secret note, the
Reporting Officer should state either that he/she had not watched the officer’s work for sufficient time to form a
definite judgement or that he/she has heard nothing against the officer, as the case may be.

(b) If, as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are cleared, the officer’s integrity should be
certified and an entry made accordingly in the Performance Appraisal Report.

(c) If the doubts or suspicions are confirmed, this fact should also be recorded and duly communicated to the
officer concerned.

(d) If as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are neither cleared nor confirmed, the officers
conduct should be watched for a further period and thereafter action taken as indicated at (b) and (c) above.

44 The reporting authority is also required to record a descriptive pen-picture on the overall qualities of the officer
reported upon and his/her performance including his attitude towards weaker sections. This need not exceed about 100
words and should try to cover overall qualities of the officer including areas of strengths and lesser strengths. The pen-
picture is also meant to be a qualitative supplement to the quantitative assessments made earlier part of this section.

4.5 The reporting authority is then required to make recommendations relating to domain assignment. The list of
domains is at para 10.

4.6 Finally, the reporting authority is required to record an overall grade. This should also be done on a scale of 1-
10, with 1 referring to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest.

5. Section-IV

5.1 This Section is to be filled up by the reviewing authority. He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the

assessments made by the reporting officer. In case of disagreement, he/she may record his/her own assessment against
the work output or any of the attributes in the column specifically provided for the purpose. In case of agreement, he/she
need not fill in the column meant for him/her in the attributes/work output tables. Finally, the reviewing authority is
required to record an overall grade in the scale of 1-10.

6. Section-V
 [ भाग 1-खण्ड 3(i)] भारत का राजपत्र : असाधारण 63

6.1 This Section is to be filled by the accepting authority. He/she is required to indicate if he/she agrees with the
assessments made by the reporting authority/reviewing authorities. In case of difference of opinion, he/she is required to
give details and reasons for the same in the column specifically provided for the purpose in the table in Section V.

7. Numerical Grades

7A At several places, numerical grades are to be awarded by reporting and review authorities. These should be on a
scale of 1-10, where | refers to the lowest grade and 10 to the highest. It is expected that any grading of | or 2 (against
work output or attributes or overall grade) would be adequately justified in the pen-picture by way of specific failures
and similarly, any grade of 9 or 10 would be justified with respect to specific accomplishments. Grades of 1-2 or 9-10
are expected to be rare occurrences and hence the need to justify them. In awarding a numerical grade the reporting and
reviewing authorities should rate the officer against a larger population of his/her peers that may be currently working
under them or would have worked under them in the past.

Te Weightage and Mean

Weights have been assigned to attributes and work output. The overall grade will be based on the addition of
the mean value of each group of indicators/descriptive picture in proportion to weightage assigned. The overall grade
will be the average mean of all the numerical indicators assigned by the authority.

8. Disclosure

8.1 There should be more openness in the system of appraisal. The annual PAR, including the overall grade and
integrity, should be communicated to the officer reported upon after it has been finalized by the accepting authority.

8.2 Representation

The officer reported upon may have the option to give his comments on the PAR. Such comments may be restricted
to the specific factual observations contained in the Performance Appraisal Report leading to the assessment of the
officer in terms of attributes and output. If comments are submitted, the Reporting/Reviewing/Accepting Authority
would have the option to accept them and modify the PAR accordingly. If the comments are not accepted, the views
of the Reporting/Reviewing/Accepting Authority would be communicated with reasons to the officer reported upon.
Thereafter, only if the officer reported upon so desires, he may request for the matter to be forwarded to the Referral
Board. The representation shall be confined to errors of facts and nothing else. The Referral Board shall give clear
findings on the representation and take a final decision on the assessment, including the overall grading in regard to
the parameters affected thereby. In case of an adverse entry, the entry and the overall grading may be communicated.
In case an entry is upgraded or down graded, reasons for same may be recorded in the PAR.
