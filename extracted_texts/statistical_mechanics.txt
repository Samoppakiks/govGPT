‘There are three modes of propagation of thermal energy or heat from one point to another:
Conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction mainly takes place in solids where the particles
~ we fixed at their positions. Here, the thermal energy travels with the help of lattice vibrations
Convection takes place in liquids and gases which have loosely bound particles capable of moving
: _ fom one point to another in the container. Thermal energy thus travels with the actual motion of
particles One thing which is common to both conduction and convection is that for heat to travel
from one point to another by either of these modes, a medium is necessary between the two points

The substance itself acts as a medium in most of the cases

The third mode of propagation of thermal energy, i.e., radiation, however, does not require the
presence of a medium. A body loses heat by this mode even when it is kept in vacuum. We receive
Sun's heat on earth although there is empty space between the sun and the earth except for a thin
layer of atmosphere. In radiation, thermal energy is carried by the electromagnetic waves. These
®M. waves are also called thermal radiation and are emitted by all bodies having a temperature
stealer than aboslute zero. The energy carried by these waves is called the ‘radiant energy.

(1) All bodies emit thermal radiation at all temperatures above absolute zero irrespective of
~~ their surroundings

The rate of ice cae body depends only on its temperature, its surface area, and the

4) There is a continuous exchange of radiation between a body and its surroundings and the
rise or fall in its temperature is purely a consequence of this exchange

It is easy to understand on the basis of this theory, why a person standing near a furnace feels

Sides being a ‘perfect absorber’, ablack body is a ‘perfect emitter’. It emits all the wavelengths

8.5 KIRCHOFF’S LAW OF THERMAL RADIATION Fig. 8.1

Kirchoff *s law of thermal radiation states that for a given wavelength, the ratio of the emissive
power to the absorptive power of a substance at a given temperature is constant and is equal to
the emissive power of a perfectly black-body at that temperature.

pLANCK’S RADIATION LAW
1900 successfully described the energy distribution in the black-body radiation by
presence of vibrating entities inside the enclosure which were called ‘resonators’
by him. —
ptions proposed by him to derive the famous ‘Planck’s distribution law’ are
known as the ‘Planck’s hypothesis’. According to this hypothesis: ,

walls of an enclosure (or any black-body) are made up of billions of simple
harmonic oscillators of molecular dimensions vibrating at their characteristic frequencies.
aban ators are responsible for the exchange of energy between matter (walls) and

oscillators or resonators cannot emit or absorb energy continuously but can do

SPECTRUM
Lummerand Pringsheim, during the year 1893 to 1899, investigated experimentally the distribution
- ofenergy in the black-body radiation spectra emitted by a black-body kept at different temperatures.
The results of their experiment is shown graphically in Fig. 8.13. The curves in the figure indicate
the following peculiar characteristics:
1 A black-body at a given temperature radiates all the wavelengths. The curves in Fig. 8.13
_ get infinitely close to the x-axis but never touch it showing thereby that the energy radiated

_ for any wavelength is never ever zero.

2. For black-body at a given temperature, the radiant energy is not uniformly distributed over

__ different wavelengths.

3 At a given temperature, the radiant energy is maximum for a certain wavelen

8.20 RADIATION PYROMETERS

‘The word ‘Pyrometer’ is derived from the Greek word ‘pyro’ meaning fire. Pyrometer i§
measuring thermal radiation emitted from a far-away object to determine its surface temp
For this reason, Pyrometers are also called ‘radiation thermometers’. We will discuss
types of Pyrometer: total radiation pyrometers and optical pyrometers.

8.20.1 Total Radiation Pyrometers —

The total radiation pyrometers are based on Stefan’s law, E = oT * was devised by Fe
His instrument, also known as the Fery’s total radiation pyrometer, is shown in Fig. 8

it consists of a concave mirror M made of nickel-plated copper, with an eyepiece o
fitted coaxially into a hole at its centre. The position of M can be adjusted with th
rack and pinion arrangement R. A metal disc d, with its side facing the mirror paint
placed at the focus of the mirror to receive the radiation from the body whose temp
be measured, after reflection at the mirror. Any direct radiation is prevented from r
disc d by covering it by an enclosure. A thermocouple junction is placed at the back
d to record its temperature with the help of a galvanometer G.

Fig. 8.15

~ Avery important condition which should always be met is that the image of the object should be
‘alittle larger than the aperture in the diaphragm so as to cover it completely. If it is not so, the disc
may be affected by the radiation from the other surrounding objects. With this condition fulfilled,
the galvanometer reading only depends on the temperature of the source and is independent of
its distance, If the distance be doubled, the amount of radiation falling on the disc becomes
one-fourth (in accordance with the inverse-square law). The area of the image is also reduced to
one-fourth and therefore, the intensity of the image and hence the temperature measured remain
__ Thepyrometeris usually caliberated by keeping a source at various temperatures.
To measure a temperature higher than the range: for which the pyrometer is
: caliberated, a rotating sector device is used. It consists of a circular opaque disc, हर }
fom which a sector making an angle 6 at its centre is cut off (Fig. 8.16). This

device is then rotated about the axis of the pyrometer. It allows a fraction 6/360

3.21 ADVANTAGES OF RADIATION PYROMETERS

1. The biggest advantage of radiation pyrometers over other temperature measuring devices
is that there is no need for them to be in direct contact with the object whose temperatur
is to be measured

2. There is no upper limit of temperature which can be measured by radiation pyrometers

Pyrometers are suitable to measure temperatures high enough for the object to radiat

‘significantly. This puts a lower limit of about 600°C on the temperature which can be m¢ e

by a pyrometer. Further, pyrometers are based on the radiation laws which apply only f
bodies. Therefore, the temperature obtained by them is the ‘black-body temperature’ of
and not the actual temperatures. —

Another limitation which is specific to the optical pyrometers is that the radiation from th

source, or atleast a part of it, has to be in the visible range
